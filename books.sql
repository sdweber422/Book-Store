Itprovides a real–world methodology for managing portfolioscontaining any nonlinear security. It presents risks from thevantage point of the option market maker and arbitrage operator.The only book about derivatives risk written by an experiencedtrader with theoretical training, it remolds option theory to fitthe practitioner′s environment. As a larger share of marketexposure cannot be properly captured by mathematical models, notedoption arbitrageur Nassim Taleb uniquely covers both on–model andoff–model derivatives risks. The author discusses, in plain English, vital issues,including: The generalized option, which encompasses all instruments withconvex payoff, including a trader′s potential bonus. The techniques for trading exotic options, including binary,barrier, multiasset, and Asian options, as well as methods to takeinto account the wrinkles of actual, non–bellshapeddistributions. Market dynamics viewed from the practitioner′s vantage point,including liquidity holes, portfolio insurance, squeezes, fattails, volatility surface, GARCH, curve evolution, static optionreplication, correlation instability, Pareto–Levy, regime shifts,autocorrelation of price changes, and the severe flaws in the valueat risk method. New tools to detect risks, such as higher moment analysis,topography exposure, and nonparametric techniques. The path dependence of all options hedged dynamically. Dynamic Hedging is replete with helpful tools, market anecdotes,at–a–glance risk management rules distilling years of market lore,and important definitions. The book contains modules in which thefundamental mathematics of derivatives, such as the Brownianmotion, Ito′s lemma, the numeraire paradox, the Girsanov change ofmeasure, and the Feynman–Kac solution are presented in intuitivepractitioner′s language. Dynamic Hedging is an indispensable and definitive reference formarket makers, academics, finance students, risk managers, andregulators. The definitive book on options trading and risk management "If pricing is a science and hedging is an art, Taleb is avirtuoso." –Bruno Dupire, Head of Swaps and Options Research,Paribas Capital Markets "This is not merely the best book on how options trade, it isthe only book." –Stan Jonas, Managing Director, FIMAT–SocietyGARCH "Dynamic Hedging bridges the gap between what the besttraders know and what the best scholars can prove." –WilliamMargrabe, President, The William Margrabe Group, Inc. "The most comprehensive, insightful, intuitive work on thesubject. It is instrumental for both beginning and experiencedtraders."– "A tour de force. That rare find, a book of great practical andtheoretical value. Taleb successfully bridges the gap between theacademic and the real world. Interesting, provocative, wellwritten.

General equilibrium models form a convenient context for analyzing such alternative government policies. In the past ten years, the strengths of general equilibrium models and the corresponding deficiencies of Keynesian and monetarist models of the 1960s have induced macroeconomists to begin applying general equilibrium models. This book describes some general equilibrium models that are dynamic, that have been built to help interpret time-series of observations of economic aggregates and to predict the consequences of alternative government interventions. The first part of the book describes dynamic programming, search theory, and real dynamic capital pricing models. Among the applications are stochastic optimal growth models, matching models, arbitrage pricing theories, and theories of interest rates, stock prices, and options. The remaining parts of the book are devoted to issues in monetary theory; currency-in-utility-function models, cash-in-advance models, Townsend turnpike models, and overlapping generations models are all used to study a set of common issues. By putting these models to work on concrete problems in exercises offered throughout the text, Sargent provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these models of money. An appendix on functional analysis shows the unity that underlies the mathematics used in disparate areas of rational expectations economics. This book on dynamic equilibrium macroeconomics is suitable for graduate-level courses; a companion book, Exercises in "Dynamic Macroeconomic Theory," provides answers to the exercises and is also available from Harvard University Press.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nVuyXF8ibeIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Dynamic Macroeconomic Theory');

For the Kellehers, Maine is a place where children run in packs, showers are taken outdoors, and old Irish songs are sung around a piano. Their beachfront property, won on a barroom bet after the war, sits on three acres of sand and pine nestled between stretches of rocky coast, with one tree bearing the initials “A.H.” At the cottage, built by Kelleher hands, cocktail hour follows morning mass, nosy grandchildren snoop in drawers, and decades-old grudges simmer beneath the surface. As three generations of Kelleher women descend on the property one summer, each brings her own hopes and fears. Maggie is thirty-two and pregnant, waiting for the perfect moment to tell her imperfect boyfriend the news; Ann Marie, a Kelleher by marriage, is channeling her domestic frustration into a dollhouse obsession and an ill-advised crush; Kathleen, the black sheep, never wanted to set foot in the cottage again; and Alice, the matriarch at the center of it all, would trade every floorboard for a chance to undo the events of one night, long ago.

Dramatic events such as the protests from Seattle to Genoa, have captured media headlines. But media headlines leave key questions unanswered, questions about the ultimate significance of the challenges posed by global social movements and the development of civil society, both South and North.This book sets out to explore the lessons from these experiences of social mobilisation. How can non-governmental organisations, community-based organisations and the labour and trade union movement develop effective campaigning alliances -- without becoming institutionalised and incorporated themselves? How can they maintain an effective balance between winning immediate gains without losing sight of longer-term strategies for transformation? How can they work with celebrities to gain media attention -- without losing control of the message? And how can social movements develop organisational forms that are genuinely representative and democratically accountable, globally? These questions are explored through case studies of particular networks, movements and campaigns, to tackle the causes of social inequality and social injustice. It concludes by exploring lessons for building global challenges to neo-liberal agendas and developing more transformatory approaches.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ytBkCPHBWEgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Global Citizens');

''Global City-Regions'' represents a multifaceted effort to deal with the many different issues raised by these developments. It seeks at once to define the question of global city-regions and to describe the internal and external dynamics that shape them; it proposes a theorization of global city-regions based on their economic and political responses to intensifying levels of globalization; and it offers a number of policy insights into the severe social problems that confront global city-regions as they come face to face with an economically and politically neoliberal world. At a moment when globalization is increasingly subject to critical scrutiny in many different quarters, this book provides a timely overview of its effects on urban and regional development, one of its most important (but perhaps least understood) corollaries.

Each chapter is a self-contained introduction ti its particular subject, and makes few specific references to other chapters. Chapters 1 examines the relationship between the molecular and continuum models of the fluid, and between the Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions of the latter. Ch.2 is a broad introduction to the fluid dynamics of rotating, stratified flows. Ch.3 adddresses large-scale ocean circulation. Chs.4,5 and 6 discuss the theory of turbulence, including elementary ideas based on vorticity laws (Ch.4), statistical turbulence theory (Ch.5), and the applications of these ideas to quasigeostrophic flows in the Earth''s oceans and atmosphere (Ch.6). Ch.7 surveys Hamiltonoian fluid dynamics, including the interaction between waves and currents, and "balanced" approximations to nearly geostrophic flow. Overall, the emphasis is on physical ideas rather than mathematical techniques.

The book you are about to enjoy was rescued from his four computers, culled from an archive of chapters from his long-awaited novel-in-progress, as well as his short stories, speeches, articles, interviews, and letters. In a way that none of his previous books could, The Salmon of Doubt provides the full, dazzling, laugh-out-loud experience of a journey through the galaxy as perceived by Douglas Adams. From a boy’s first love letter (to his favorite science fiction magazine) to the distinction of possessing a nose of heroic proportions; from climbing Kilimanjaro in a rhino costume to explaining why Americans can’t make a decent cup of tea; from lyrical tributes to the sublime pleasures found in music by Procol Harum, the Beatles, and Bach to the follies of his hopeless infatuation with technology; from fantastic, fictional forays into the private life of Genghis Khan to extended visits with Dirk Gently and Zaphod Beeblebrox: this is the vista from the elevated perch of one of the tallest, funniest, most brilliant, and most penetrating social critics and thinkers of our time.

In studying the natural and human forces that shape the rivers and mountains of that region, geologist David Montgomery has learned to see the evolution and near-extinction of the salmon as a story of changing landscapes. Montgomery shows how a succession of historical experiences -first in the United Kingdom, then in New England, and now in the Pacific Northwest -repeat a disheartening story in which overfishing and sweeping changes to rivers and seas render the world inhospitable to salmon. In King of Fish, Montgomery traces the human impacts on salmon over the last thousand years and examines the implications both for salmon recovery efforts and for the more general problem of human impacts on the natural world. What does it say for the long-term prospects of the world''s many endangered species if one of the most prosperous regions of the richest country on earth cannot accommodate its icon species?

Are the financial markets really predictable? Does an ancient artifact hold the key to how some of the world s wealthiest families made their fortunes?When a mysterious granite and cypress Egyptian box is found hidden away in a secret room in the palatial Biltmore Estate, twin scientists Alex and Nicholas Shepard work to unlock the secret of its intricate dials, gauges, crystals, and carvings. What they discover has the potential to make them rich beyond their wildest dreams. But it could also collapse financial markets, bankrupt corporations around the globe, and destroy many of the world s most powerful families. As the twins quickly find out, people will not only kill to make money, but will kill to keep it. What begins as a simple scientific experiment in the stock market quickly descends into a nightmarish intrigue of murder, deception, and mystery. When one Shepard brother is killed, the surviving twin and his wife find themselves in a desperate gambit to learn the truth about the box s legacy. Using ancient documents found with the box, they unearth clues to trace its history through the ages, from the catacombs of Paris to the Knights of the Templar in Scotland. Their investigation takes them from London to Paris, Venice, and finally, to the Vatican itself, where they uncover the greatest deception ever perpetuated by man. Robert D. Taylor s enthralling debut novel Paradigm is a unique and masterful blend of intelligent scientific suspense and bold historical mystery stretching from earliest antiquity to the present day and beyond. His intriguing plot and cast of memorable characters makes for a suspenseful pager-turn that will keep readers guessing about where the lines of reality and fiction merge. Paradigm demands we believe the unbelievable. The challenge of finding out just what is truly real and what is not is now up to you. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Robert D. Taylor is a research scientist and the CEO of Trend Corporation, Inc. He is a successful businessman. His research focus in econo-physics has been vital to the development of the economic modeling software. He lives with his wife in Atlanta, Georgia.Reviews: "Robert Taylor''s fascinating, ingenious, and well-written novel, Paradigm, should be at the top of everyone''s fall 2005 reading list. It''s a fabulous book about the breathtaking pursuit of the secrets behind a mysterious Egyptian box and how that desperate chase leads to riches, treachery, and murder. Paradigm is the Da Vinci Code for Wall Street arbitragers and others who enjoy fantasizing about offbeat ways to make money " (Dan E. Moldea, Author of The Hoffa Wars)"Robert Taylor''s intelligent Wall Street thriller, Paradigm, has more twists and turns than a steep mountain road. It''s a very well written, first rate murder mystery that will challenge the readers intellectually." (Vincent Bugliosi, author of Helter Skelter, ''Till Death Do Us Part, and the acclaimed New York Times #1 hardcover bestseller, And the Sea Will Tell.)"The science wrapped in this novel will challenge how we think about gravity and the relationship between science and business. Truth and fiction merge to tell an intriguing tale." (M. Douglas Ivester, Former Chairman and CEO, Coca-Cola)"Simultaneously an exciting tale of intrigue and adventure and an intellectual paradigm-quake, this enthralling reality-fiction novel''s emotionally gripping plot and players completely absorb both the reader''s mind and heart until the final, satisfying denouement." (Dr. Robert W. Bass, M.A. Oxon -Rhodes Scholar- Professor. of Physics & Astronomy, BYU 1971-81, retired) Paradigm rockets along powered by the ultimate what if. WHAT IF someone could predict when the stock market would rise or fall? Paradigm weaves a tale full of suspense and secrecy and Robert Taylor takes it even one step further the science behind the story is real! (Jeff Sagansky, past President of CBS Entertainment and Tri-Star Pictures) Paradigm is not only a quick read but a wicked blend of both reality and fiction. If you liked The Da Vinci Code, you ll love Paradigm! (Alan (Ace) Greenburg, Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the Executive Committee, Bear Stearns) Almost immediately, I realized this book is reality itself. Reading it was like watching wonderful, complex people on a screen as they move through their extraordinary lives. Paradigm redefines not only how we will view the stock market, but novel writing itself.

From bloody skirmishes with Indians on the early frontier to the Logan County mine war, the story of West Virginia is punctuated with episodes as colorful and rugged as the mountains that dominate its landscape. In this first modern comprehensive history, Otis Rice and Stephen Brown balance these episodes of mountaineer individualism against the complexities of industrial development and the growth of social institutions, analyzing the events and personalities that have shaped the state. To create this history, the authors weave together many strands from the past and present. Included among these are geological and geographical features; the prehistoric inhabitants; exploration and settlement; relations with the Indians; the land systems and patterns of ownership; the Civil War and the formation of the state from the western counties of Virginia; the legacy of Reconstruction; politics and government; industrial development; labor problems and advances; and cultural aspects such as folkways, education, religion, and national and ethnic influences. For this second edition, the authors have added a new chapter, bringing the original material up to date and carrying the West Virginia story through the presidential election of 1992. Otis K.

Blending personal meditations, interviews, photographs, and cultural analysis, Inside the Mouse looks at Disney World''s architecture and design, its consumer practices, and its use of Disney characters and themes. This book takes the reader on an alternative ride through "the happiest place on earth" while asking "What makes this forty-three-square-mile theme park the quintessential embodiment of American leisure?" Turning away from the programmed entertainment that Disney presents, the authors take a peek behind the scenes of everyday experience at Disney World. In their consideration of the park as both private corporate enterprise and public urban environment, the authors focus on questions concerning the production and consumption of leisure. Featuring over fifty photographs and interviews with workers that strip "cast members" of their cartoon costumes, this captivating work illustrates the high-pressure dynamics of the typical family vacation as well as a tour of Disney World that looks beyond the controlled facade of themed attractions. As projects like EuroDisney and the proposed Disney America test the strength of the Disney cultural monolith, Inside the Mouse provides a timely assessment of the serious business of supplying pleasure in contemporary U.S. culture. Written for the general reader interested in the many worlds of Disney, this engrossing volume will also find fans among students and scholars of cultural studies.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C_FFMePR204C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Inside the Mouse');

Out of prison and dying from the AIDS virus he contracted there, he will get revenge on Cross before he dies.

Thomas Augustine Pierce has been chasing his demon, Mr. Smith, since the savage murder of his fiancee. Mr. Smith is a unique monster, with actions toward his victims so insane-so unimaginable-that he is thought of as "not of the earth." Pierce, known in the business as St. Augustine because of his track record for catching killers and his invaluable status to the FBI and Interpol, may even be better than Cross.When things heat up and Alex is in a near-death coma following an attack in his own home, Pierce goes to Washington to help with the investigation. But just as he begins to piece together the mystery of how Gary Soneji could have mortally wounded Cross after he was believed to be dead, he is summoned to Paris with a postcard from Mr. Smith inviting him to a very special killing.The body count is high, the tension the highest, and the two killers on the loose are watching every move their pursuers make.

Semiconductor-based lasers are also in the solid state, but are generally considered separately from solid-state lasers. Generally, the active medium of a solid-state laser consists of a glass or crystalline host material to which is added a dopant such as neodymium, chromium, erbium, or other ions. Many of the common dopants are rare earth elements, because the excited states of such ions are not strongly coupled with thermal vibrations of the crystalline lattice (phonons), and the lasing threshold can be reached at relatively low brightness of pump. There are many hundreds of solid-state media in which laser action has been achieved, but relatively few types are in widespread use. Of these, probably the most common type is neodymium doped YAG. Neodymium-doped glass (Nd:glass) and Ytterbium-doped glasses and ceramics are used in solid-state lasers at extremely high power (terawatt scale), high energy (megajoules) multiple beam systems for inertial confinement fusion.

Add in the challenge of cross-cultural differences, cultural collision occurs leading to worse negotiation outcomes in intercultural negotiation than intracultural ones (e.g., Adair et al., 2001; Adair et al., 2007). Given that intercultural negotiations are both challenging and prevalent, this study investigates how to improve intercultural negotiation effectiveness, and demonstrates when intercultural negotiators can in fact achieve significantly better outcomes than intracultural negotiators (i.e. cultural synergy). Drawing insights from research on cultural essentialism and its influence on intergroup relations and conflicts, I examine the interaction between essentialist beliefs and the cultural context in negotiation. Using an actor-partner interdependence model, I reveal that whether cultures collide or synergize in intercultural negotiation depends on negotiators'' endorsement of cultural essentialist beliefs. Intercultural negotiators who believed that cultural characteristics are malleable (i.e. non-essentialist beliefs) achieved higher individual gains and joint gains, compared to not only intercultural negotiators who endorsed stronger essentialist beliefs, but also intracultural negotiators. Beyond identifying why cultures collide in negotiation, these findings pave the way for future research to examine factors that help negotiators harvest cultural synergy for favorable negotiation outcomes.', DEFAULT, 'When Cultures Collide and Synergize');

Covey’s proven 7 Habits to create a leadership program for kids of all ages so they can be more effective, more goal oriented, and more successful In today’s world, we are inundated with information about who to be, what to do, and how to live. But what if there was a way to learn not just what to think about, but how to think? A program that taught how to manage priorities, focus on goals, and be a positive influence? The Leader in Me is that program. In this bestseller, Stephen R. Covey took the 7 Habits that have already changed the lives of millions of readers and showed how even young children can use them as they develop. These habits—be proactive, begin with the end in mind, put first things first, think win-win, seek to understand and then to be understood, synergize, and sharpen the saw—are being adapted by schools around the country in leadership programs, most famously at the A.B Combs Elementary school in Raleigh. Not only does it work, but it works better than anyone could have imaged. This book is full of examples of how the students blossom under the program—the classroom that decided to form a support group for one of their classmates who had behavioral problems, the fourth grader who found a way to overcome his fear of public speaking and wound up taking his class to see him compete in a national story telling competitive, or the seven-year-old who told her father than they needed to go outside and play because they both needed to “sharpen the saw.” Perfect for individuals and corporations alike, The Leader in Me shows how easy it is to incorporate these skills into daily life. It is a timely answer to many of the challenges facing today’s young people, businesses, parents, and educators—one that is perfectly matched to the growing demands of our certain future.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IXw3AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Leader in Me');

For three- or five-year periods the experiment measured both use and health outcomes in populations carefully selected to be representative of both urban and rural regions throughout the United States. Participants were enrolled in a range of insurance plans requiring different levels of copayment for medical care, from zero to 95 percent. The researchers found that in plans that reimbursed a higher proportion of the bill, patients used substantially more services - indeed, those who paid nothing used 40 percent more services than those required to pay a high deductible - but the effect on the health of the average person was negligible. In addition, participants who were assigned at random to a well-established health maintenance organization used hospitals substantially less than those in the fee-for-service system, again with no measurable effect on the health of the average person.

The focus of that testimony was Song of Russia, a 1944 pro-Soviet film that Rand decried for its unrealistic, absurdly flattering portrait of life in the communist country. Ayn Rand scholar Robert Mayhew focuses on this controversial period of American and Hollywood history by examining both the film and the furor surrounding Rand''s HUAC testimony. His analysis provides the first detailed history of any of the pro-Soviet films to come out of 1940s Hollywood. Mayhew begins by offering a brief synopsis of the MGM film, followed by an account of its production, as well as its reception. Most significantly, Mayhew analyzes Rand''s appearance before HUAC and discusses the response to her much-maligned testimony. By carefully scrutinizing this one episode in the history of communism and anti-communism in 1940s Hollywood, Mayhew presents a more accurate picture of those times and the issues surrounding them. His study allows for a re-evaluation of the role of communism in Hollywood, the nature of the HUAC, and even the Hollywood Ten.

Drawing on unprecedented access to Rand''s private papers and the original, unedited versions of Rand''s journals, Jennifer Burns offers a groundbreaking reassessment of this key cultural figure, examining her life, her ideas, and her impact on conservative political thought. Goddess of the Market follows Rand from her childhood in Russia through her meteoric rise from struggling Hollywood screenwriter to bestselling novelist, including the writing of her wildly successful The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. Burns highlights the two facets of Rand''s work that make her a perennial draw for those on the right: her promotion of capitalism, and her defense of limited government. Both sprang from her early, bitter experience of life under Communism, and became among the most deeply enduring of her messages, attracting a diverse audience of college students and intellectuals, business people and Republican Party activists, libertarians and conservatives. The book also traces the development of Rand''s Objectivist philosophy and her relationship with Nathaniel Branden, her closest intellectual partner, with whom she had an explosive falling out in 1968.

Thorne shares his experiences working as the science adviser on the film and then moves on to the science itself. In chapters on wormholes, black holes, interstellar travel, and much more, Thorne’s scientific insights—many of them triggered during the actual scripting and shooting of Interstellar—describe the physical laws that govern our universe and the truly astounding phenomena that those laws make possible.

His research shows that a whole sequence of major fires after Shek Kip Mei, and the political costs of the Mainland sending comfort missions to fire victims both before and after were needed to bring about the final commitment to provide mass public housing. In his critical examination of the conventional position, Professor Smart bases his case on a thorough reading of government records and provides a careful investigation into the origins of the public housing policy in Hong Kong.

While Alec Ross was working as Hillary Clinton''s Senior Advisor on Innovation, he traveled to forty-one countries. He visited some of the toughest places in the world—from refugee camps of Congo to Syrian war zones. From phone-charger stands in Rwanda to R&D labs in South Korea, Ross has seen what the future holds. Over the past two decades, the Internet has radically changed markets and businesses worldwide. InThe Industries of the Future, Ross shows us what''s next, highlighting the best opportunities for progress and explaining why countries thrive or sputter. He examines the specific fields that will most shape our economic future over the next ten years, including cybercrime and cybersecurity, the commercialization of genomics, the next step for big data, and the coming impact of digital technology on money, payments, and markets. And in each of these realms, Ross addresses the toughest questions: How will we have to adapt to the changing nature of work? Is the prospect of cyberwar sparking the next arms race? How can the world''s rising nations hope to match Silicon Valley in creating their own innovation hotspots? Ross blends storytelling and economic analysis to give a vivid and informed perspective on how sweeping global trends are affecting the ways we live, incorporating the insights of leaders ranging from the founders of Google and Twitter to defense experts like David Petraeus. The Industries of the Future takes the intimidating, complex topics that many of us know to be important and boils them down into clear, plain-spoken language.

From Roger''s review of Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo (0 stars): "The movie created a spot of controversy in February 2005. According to a story by Larry Carroll of MTV News, Rob Schneider took offense when Patrick Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times listed this year''s Best Picture nominees and wrote that they were ''ignored, unloved, and turned down flat by most of the same studios that . . . bankroll hundreds of sequels, including a follow-up to Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, a film that was sadly overlooked at Oscar time because apparently nobody had the foresight to invent a category for Best Running Penis Joke Delivered by a Third-Rate Comic.'' Schneider retaliated by attacking Goldstein in full-page ads in Daily Variety and the Hollywood Reporter. In an open letter to Goldstein, Schneider wrote: ''Well, Mr. Goldstein, I decided to do some research to find out what awards you have won. I went online and found that you have won nothing. Absolutely nothing. No journalistic awards of any kind. . . . Maybe you didn''t win a Pulitzer Prize because they haven''t invented a category for Best Third-Rate, Unfunny Pompous Reporter Who''s Never Been Acknowledged by His Peers. . . .'' Schneider was nominated for a 2000 Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actor, but lost to Jar-Jar Binks. But Schneider is correct, and Patrick Goldstein has not yet won a Pulitzer Prize. Therefore, Goldstein is not qualified to complain that Columbia financed Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo while passing on the opportunity to participate in Million Dollar Baby, Ray, The Aviator, Sideways, and Finding Neverland.

We''ve all experienced moments when we lose control of a situation and ourselves. Now, in Growing Yourself Back Up, the first book to explain the idea of emotional regression to the general reader, bestselling author John Lee identifies the circumstances that cause these seemingly uncontrollable feelings and shows how they are directly tied to our experience as children. No adult, explains Lee, need ever experience the helpless feelings of childhood again. Here are his proven methods and visualization exercises, developed in his popular workshops, for recognizing, preventing, and diffusing regression in ourselves and others. He teaches, for example, that adults cannot be abandoned, they can only be left; if we''re feeling abandoned we''re regressing. He also reminds us that no matter how overwhelmed we are, adults always have options; if we believe we don''t, we''re in a regression. Growing Yourself Back Up will show you how to: * develop strong emotional boundaries and convey them to others * learn the Detour Method that reverses regression * confront without regressing * communicate with the authority figures who push your buttons * minimize regression at family functions Lee offers hope--as well as practical strategies that work--for conquering those childlike feelings of powerlessness that are almost always rooted in regression.

Over recent years there have been substantial changes in those industries which are concerned with the design, purchase and use of special purpose (ie critical, high-revenue) rotating equipment. Key personnel have been the victims of early retirement or have moved to other industries: contractors and end-users have reduced their technical staff and consequently have to learn complex material ''from scratch''. As a result, many companies are finding that they are devoting unnecessary man hours to the discovery and explanation of basic principles, and having to explain these to clients who should already be aware of them. In addition, the lack of understanding by contractors and users of equipment characteristics and operating systems often results in a ''wrong fit'' and a costly reliability problem. The stakes can be high, and it against this background that this book has been published. It is the outcome of many years of Bill Forsthoffer''s design, start-up and troubleshooting experience which has resulted in well-honed teaching material which is easily readable, understandable and actually enjoyable!

Few hardware or software testing texts even touch upon validation and verification, despite the fact that, properly employed, these test tools offer system and test engineers powerful techniques for identifying and solving problems early in the design process. Together, validation and verification encompass testing, analysis, demonstration, and examination methods used to determine whether a proposed design will satisfy system requirements. System Validation and Verification clear definitions of the terms and detailed information on using these fundamental tools for problem solving. It smoothes the transition between requirements and design by providing methods for evaluating the ability of a given approach to satisfy demanding technical requirements. With this book, system and test engineers and project managers gain confidence in their designs and lessen the likelihood of serious problems cropping up late in the program. In addition to explanations of the theories behind the concepts, the book includes practical methods for each step of the process, examples from the author''s considerable experience, and illustrations and tables to support the ideas. Although not primarily a textbook, System Validation and Verification is based in part on validation and verification courses taught by the author and is an excellent supplemental reference for engineering students.

In this book, originally published in France in 1999, Groensteen explains clearly the subtle, complex workings of the medium and its unique way of combining visual, verbal, spatial, and chronological expressions. The author explores the nineteenth-century pioneer Rodolphe Töpffer, contemporary Japanese creators, George Herriman''s Krazy Kat, and modern American autobiographical comics. The System of Comics uses examples from a wide variety of countries including the United States, England, Japan, France, and Argentina. It describes and analyzes the properties and functions of speech and thought balloons, panels, strips, and pages to examine methodically and insightfully the medium''s fundamental processes. From this, Groensteen develops his own coherent, overarching theory of comics, a "system" that both builds on existing studies of the "word and image" paradigm and adds innovative approaches of his own. Examining both meaning and appreciation, the book provides a wealth of ideas that will challenge the way scholars approach the study of comics. By emphasizing not simply "storytelling techniques" but also the qualities of the printed page and the reader''s engagement, the book''s approach is broadly applicable to all forms of interpreting this evolving art. Thierry Groensteen is a comics scholar and translator in Brussels, Belgium. He is the author of La bande dessinée: Une littérature graphique and La construction de la cage, among other books.

With deposits from landowners'' rents and stock sales these bankers practised as moneylenders and money-brokers for another sector of the gentry needing capital to offset the effects of the Great Rebellion and an agricultural depression. After 1660 Clayton and Morris integrated mortgage security into banking practice.

Thus, in an ambitious attempt to turn nineteenth-century artistic discussion away from historicism, aestheticism, and materialism, Semper developed in Der Stil a complex picture of stylistic change based on scrutiny of specific objects and a remarkable grasp of cultural variety.

Advice is given on how to set up as a translator, from the purchase of equipment to the acquisition of clients. The process of translation is discussed from initial enquiry to delivery of the finished product. Hints are given on how to assess requirements, how to charge for work, how to research and use source material, and how to present the finished product. Guidance is given on where to obtain further advice and professional contacts.

All over the world, more and more people study at Western-style universities, work for Western-style companies, vote for Western-style governments, take Western medicines, wear Western clothes, and play Western sports. Yet six hundred years ago the petty kingdoms of Western Europe seemed like miserable backwaters, ravaged by incessant war and pestilence. It was Ming China or Ottoman Turkey that had the look of world civilizations. How did the West overtake its Eastern rivals? And has the zenith of Western power now passed? In Civilization: The West and the Rest, acclaimed historian Niall Ferguson argues that, beginning in the fifteenth century, the West developed six powerful new concepts that the Rest lacked: competition, science, the rule of law, modern medicine, consumerism, and the work ethic. These were the ‘killer applications’ that allowed the West to leap ahead of the Rest; opening global trade routes, exploiting new scientific knowledge, evolving representative government, more than doubling life expectancy, unleashing the industrial revolution, and hugely increasing human productivity. Civilization shows exactly how a dozen Western empires came to control three-fifths of mankind and four-fifths of the world economy. Yet now, Ferguson argues, the days of Western predominance are numbered because the Rest have finally downloaded the six killer apps the West once monopolized – while the West has literally lost faith in itself. Chronicling the rise and fall of empires alongside the clashes of civilizations, Civilization recasts world history with verve and wit. Boldly argued but also teeming with memorable characters, this is Ferguson at his very best.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mRO3xuoTTeoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Civilization');

While paintings by Pablo Picasso and Jackson Pollock sell for a hundred million dollars or more, shocking musical works from Stravinsky''s Rite of Spring onward still send ripples of unease through audiences. At the same time, the influence of modern music can be felt everywhere. Avant-garde sounds populate the soundtracks of Hollywood thrillers. Minimalist music has had a huge effect on rock, pop, and dance music from the Velvet Underground onward. Alex Ross, the brilliant music critic for The New Yorker, shines a bright light on this secret world, and shows how it has pervaded every corner of twentieth century life. The Rest Is Noise takes the reader inside the labyrinth of modern sound. It tells of maverick personalities who have resisted the cult of the classical past, struggled against the indifference of a wide public, and defied the will of dictators. Whether they have charmed audiences with the purest beauty or battered them with the purest noise, composers have always been exuberantly of the present, defying the stereotype of classical music as a dying art. Ross, in this sweeping and dramatic narrative, takes us from Vienna before the First World War to Paris in the twenties, from Hitler''s Germany and Stalin''s Russia to downtown New York in the sixties and seventies. We follow the rise of mass culture and mass politics, of dramatic new technologies, of hot and cold wars, of experiments, revolutions, riots, and friendships forged and broken. In the tradition of Simon Schama''s The Embarrassment of Riches and Louis Menand''s The Metaphysical Club, the end result is not so much a history of twentieth-century music as a history of the twentieth century through its music.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u_g_uPZO-tkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Rest Is Noise');

You have screens in your pocket, in your car, on your appliances, and maybe even on your face.

The VUI is perhaps the most critical factor in the success of any automated speech recognition (ASR) system, determining whether the user experience will be satisfying or frustrating, or even whether the customer will remain one. This book describes a practical methodology for creating an effective VUI design. The methodology is scientifically based on principles in linguistics, psychology, and language technology, and is illustrated here by examples drawn from the authors'' work at Nuance Communications, the market leader in ASR development and deployment. The book begins with an overview of VUI design issues and a description of the technology. The authors then introduce the major phases of their methodology. They first show how to specify requirements and make high-level design decisions during the definition phase. They next cover, in great detail, the design phase, with clear explanations and demonstrations of each design principle and its real-world applications. Finally, they examine problems unique to VUI design in system development, testing, and tuning. Key principles are illustrated with a running sample application. A companion Web site provides audio clips for each example: www.VUIDesign.org The cover photograph depicts the first ASR system, Radio Rex: a toy dog who sits in his house until the sound of his name calls him out.

Therefore performance and reliability guarantees for these systems are crucial. To this end, versatile probabilistic modelling and analysis techniques have been developed. However existing probabilistic analysis methods are inherently limited to small systems. This dissertation introduces a new probabilistic analysis method that scales to large and even infinite systems which are far out of reach of previous methods. The key idea is to approximate a given system by a smaller abstraction which is refined automatically until sufficient precision has been achieved. The thesis discusses the various foundational and practical challenges involved in developing this method, as well as its effectiveness in practice.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yOdLtYeGiqQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Refined Probabilistic Abstraction');

The next paper focuses on four issues regarding affordances: the ontological status, whether or not they are necessarily related to (one''s own) actions, the relation between affordances and effectivities, and the nesting of affordances. Finally, several exemplars of phenomenologically driven perceptual research are examined, as well as the advantages over extant theories of affordances.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-nrsAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'How Shall Affordances Be Refined?');

Nowadays, zeolites also find applications as catalysts in a wide array of chemical reactions such as; base catalyzed reactions, Redox reactions and catalytic reactions on transition metals and their complexes in confined environments. The concepts of Brønsted or Lewis acid-base pairs are adequately illustrated in the literature and well-understood in terms of structural and electronic properties of zeolites. By contrast, properties of chemically modified silicates, aluminosilicates and aluminophosphates have not yet been fully explored. The list of oxydo-reduction reactions performed in the presence of these new materials is growing as demonstrated by the selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides or the numerous oxidations employing hydrogen peroxide. Much effort is currently being made to get a better insight into the nature of the sites involved. The zeolite lattice may also be used as a host for encapsulated complexes or metallic clusters allowing the control of nuclearity of these active species and the steric constraints imposed on the reactants. Molecular sieve and shape selectivity effects have also constituted fascinating aspects of zeolite properties. Recent developments leading to increasingly large pore sizes with VPI-5, cloverite and more recently mesoporous molecular sieves have broadened the spectrum of these applications. Indeed, larger and larger reactant and product molecules can be accommodated in these lattices. These new adsorbant/adsorbate systems create additional needs for experimental data and theoretical descriptions of transport properties, in particular of mono- and multi-components diffusion coefficients in the zeolite pore lattice. All these themes, representing the forefront and current trends in zeolite research, were discussed in the submitted papers to the symposium and are widely represented in the selected papers contained in this volume. A feature common to most of these contributions is the combined use of a variety of analytical techniques. Some of these techniques are at the frontier of the latest analytical developments such as multiple scattering EXAFS and bidimensional MAS-NMR.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jpmCFHnprRYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Zeolites: A Refined Tool for Designing Catalytic Sites');

This long-awaited second edition, expanded and completely updated, will be equally revered. Like its predecessor, this edition of Indexing Books offers comprehensive, reliable treatment of indexing principles and practices relevant to authors and indexers alike. In addition to practical advice, the book presents a big-picture perspective on the nature and purpose of indexes and their role in published works. New to this edition are discussions of "information overload" and the role of the index, open-system versus closed-system indexing, electronic submission and display of indexes, and trends in software development, among other topics. Mulvany is equally comfortable focusing on the nuts and bolts of indexing—how to determine what is indexable, how to decide the depth of an index, and how to work with publisher instructions—and broadly surveying important sources of indexing guidelines such as The Chicago Manual of Style, Sun Microsystems, Oxford University Press, NISO TR03, and ISO 999. Authors will appreciate Mulvany''s in-depth consideration of the costs and benefits of preparing one''s own index versus hiring a professional, while professional indexers will value Mulvany''s insights into computer-aided indexing. Helpful appendixes include resources for indexers, a worksheet for general index specifications, and a bibliography of sources to consult for further information on a range of topics. Indexing Books is both a practical guide and a manifesto about the vital role of the human-crafted index in the Information Age.

Now, she brings together a number of the leading researchers in the area of platform strategy to give us a book that will be a key reference for both practitioners and academics. Adam Brandenburger, New York University, US Annabelle Gawer s collected volume of research shows that a vibrant community of scholars has arisen around platforms and innovation. Each of the chapters is first rate, with top researchers offering some of their latest work. This will be an indispensable book for students of innovation and technology management everywhere. Henry Chesbrough, University of California, Berkeley, US Annabelle Gawer s Platforms, Markets and Innovation is the first serious exploration of the critical but subtle role that platforms play in business, society and our personal lives. As digital technologies penetrate every nook and cranny of the world around us, we rely on platforms to both help us use the new technologies, as well as to organize new markets of innovation that add applications on top of the platforms and make them far more valuable. Dr Gawer s excellent book is designed to help us understand the mysterious nature of platforms. It brings together the insights of twenty-four experts around the world who contributed to the fourteen chapters of the book. Dr Gawer s book is invaluable to anyone trying to understand the nuanced nature of platforms, and their implications for the evolution of innovation in the 21st century. Irving Wladawsky-Berger, IBM Academy of Technology, US The emergence of platforms is a novel phenomenon impacting most industries, from products to services. Industry platforms such as Microsoft Windows or Google, embedded within industrial ecosystems, have redesigned our industrial landscapes, upset the balance of power between firms, fostered innovation and raised new questions on competition and innovation. Annabelle Gawer presents cutting-edge contributions from 24 top international scholars from 19 universities across Europe, the USA and Asia, from the disciplines of strategy, economics, innovation, organization studies and knowledge management. The novel insights assembled in this volume constitute a fundamental step towards an empirically based, nuanced understanding of the nature of platforms and the implications they hold for the evolution of industrial innovation. The book provides an overview of platforms and discusses governance, management, design and knowledge issues. With a multidisciplinary approach, this book will strongly appeal to academics and advanced students in management, innovation, strategy, economics and design. It will also prove an enlightening read for business managers in IT industries.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1BvhQT8SHZkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Platforms, Markets and Innovation');

Art platforms can occur in numerous contexts bringing about genuinely new cultural production, that, given enough force, come together to sustain an open mechanism while negotiating social, technical and political modes of power. Software art, digital forms of literature, 8-bit music, 3D art forms, pro-surfers, and networks of geeks are test beds for enquiry into what brings and holds art platforms together. Goriunova provides a new means of understanding the development of cultural forms on the Internet, placing the phenomenon of participatory and social networks in a conceptual and historical perspective, and offering powerful tools for researching cultural phenomena overlooked by other approaches.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=svTOmgMUGW0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Art Platforms and Cultural Production on the Internet');

Gardner and Davis are concerned with three vital areas of adolescent life: identity, intimacy, and imagination. Through innovative research, including interviews of young people, focus groups of those who work with them, and a unique comparison of youthful artistic productions before and after the digital revolution, the authors uncover the drawbacks of apps: they may foreclose a sense of identity, encourage superficial relations with others, and stunt creative imagination. On the other hand, the benefits of apps are equally striking: they can promote a strong sense of identity, allow deep relationships, and stimulate creativity. The challenge is to venture beyond the ways that apps are designed to be used, Gardner and Davis conclude, and they suggest how the power of apps can be a springboard to greater creativity and higher aspirations.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1dE_AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The App Generation');

When experienced parents decide to adopt an older child or a sibling group, they jump through all kinds of bureaucratic hoops â?? background checks, interviews, group meetings, reading assignments, classes, etc. But most often the typically developing children these adults are already parenting (whether through birth or adoption) are left out of the process, informed that a new kid is coming, and simply expected to â??adjustâ?? to the addition of another sibling. The addition of a child with a history of neglect or trauma cannot be a seamless transition. The expectations of everyone involved â?? parents, new siblings, and, yes, professionals facilitating the adoption â?? must be realistic, taking into account that the new child will need special attention that may take away time and attention from the already resident kids, that family life is likely to be turned topsy turvy until appropriate counseling and support are in place, that relationships will change. Therapist Arleta James is certainly not the first person to recognize this, but she is the first to do something about it.

These assumptions run counter to the multicultural and religiously plural nature of our society. This book elaborates how those assumptions are descriptively incorrect, and it begins an important conversation about whether more pluralism in family law is normatively desirable. For example, may couples rely upon religious tribunals (Jewish, Muslim, or otherwise) to decide family law disputes? May couples opt into stricter divorce rules, either through premarital contracts or ''covenant marriages''? How should the state respond? Intentionally interdisciplinary and international in scope, this volume contains contributions from fourteen leading scholars.

A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don''t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other. The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, "each the other''s world entire," are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.

On Bent Road, a battered red truck cruises ominously along the prairie; a lonely little girl dresses in her dead aunt''s clothes; a boy hefts his father''s rifle in search of a target; and a mother realizes she no longer knows how to protect her children.

McInerney This volume deals with a wealth of issues related to self, from the overarching theoretical perspective of Bandura and his careful and thorough analysis of the agentic self, highlighting the complexities of our multiple selves acting in an integrated, holistic, and dynamic fashion, to the engaging and novel treatment of selfconcept as a rope by John Hattie. From many of the chapters we see the utility value of the social cognitive theory and self-determination theory frameworks for interpreting self-processes and how these processes might drive engagement in learning. In particular we see how autonomy support, self-regulation, self-efficacy, and self-regulation are part and parcel of self-processes intimately involved as individuals work out their futures and possible selves. Entwined with these processes are the development of identity, resilience, and a sense of well-being. The BFLPE and bullying chapters provide two examples of self-processes in operation in the school context. What can we take from this? Self-processes are complex, differentiated, and yet coordinated. By focusing on the agentic self we consider the whole person-picture as a rich, integrated, and dynamic tapestry and by focusing on differentiated self elements such as self-regulation, self-determination, self-concept, and self-efficacy, we are able to examine, in more detail, some of the individual threads of the tapestry and the roles they play in the integrated self. Overall, we learn that self-processes are dynamic and are fundamental to enabling human potential', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=08q6vn9kk84C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Self-processes, Learning, and Enabling Human Potential');

insert into "books" ("description", "image_url", "title") values ('Implementing self-management for enterprise systems is difficult. First, the scale and complexity of such systems makes it hard to understand and interpret system behavior or worse, the root causes of certain behaviors. Second, it is not clear how the goals specified at a system-level translate to component-level actions that drive the system. Third, the dynamic environments in which such systems operate requires self-management techniques that not only adapt the system but also adapt their own decision making processes. Finally, to build a self-management solution that is acceptable to administrators, it should have the properties of tractability and trust, which allow an administrator to both understand and fine-tune self-management actions. This dissertation work introduces, implements, and evaluates iManage, a novel system state-space based framework for enabling self-management of enterprise-scale systems. The system state-space, in iManage, is defined to be a collection of monitored system parameters and metrics (termed system variables). In addition, from amongst the system variables, it identifies the variables of interest, which determine the operational status of a system, and the controllable variables, which are the ones that can be deterministically modified to affect the operational status of a system. Using this formal representation, we have developed and integrated into iManage techniques that establish a probabilistic model relating the variables of interest and the controllable variables under the prevailing operational conditions. Such models are then used by iManage to determine corrective actions in case of SLA violations and/or to determine per-component ranges for controllable variables, which if independently adhered to by each component, lead to SLA compliance. To address the issue of scale in determining system models, iManage makes use of a novel state-space partitioning scheme that partitions the state-space into smaller sub-spaces thereby allowing us to more precisely model the critical system aspects. Our chosen modeling techniques are such that the generated models can be easily understood and modified by the administrator. Furthermore, iManage associates each proposed self-management action with a confidence-attribute that determines whether the action in question merits autonomic enforcement or not.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mGOSIYodE58C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Enabling Scalable Self-management for Enterprise-scale Systems');

In particular attention is given to how new forms of personhood are being generated through mechanisms of giving value to culture, and how what we come to know and assume to be a ''self'' is always a classed formation. Analysing four processes: of inscription, institutionalisation, perspective-taking and exchange relationships, it challenges recent debates on reflexivity, risk, rational-action theory, individualisation and mobility, by showing how these are all reliant on fixing some people in place so that others can move.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kVX_AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Class, Self, Culture');

And how did Google searches predict the spread of the H1N1 flu outbreak? The key to answering these questions, and many more, is big data. “Big data” refers to our burgeoning ability to crunch vast collections of information, analyze it instantly, and draw sometimes profoundly surprising conclusions from it. This emerging science can translate myriad phenomena—from the price of airline tickets to the text of millions of books—into searchable form, and uses our increasing computing power to unearth epiphanies that we never could have seen before. A revolution on par with the Internet or perhaps even the printing press, big data will change the way we think about business, health, politics, education, and innovation in the years to come. It also poses fresh threats, from the inevitable end of privacy as we know it to the prospect of being penalized for things we haven’t even done yet, based on big data’s ability to predict our future behavior.

In articulating new ways of viewing urban areas and how they develop over time, Peter Bosselmann offers a stimulating guidebook for students and professionals engaged in urban design, planning, and architecture. By looking through Bosselmann’s eyes (aided by his analysis of numerous color photos and illustrations) readers will learn to “see” cities anew. Bosselmann organizes the book around seven “activities”: comparing, observing, transforming, measuring, defining, modeling, and interpreting. He introduces readers to his way of seeing by comparing satellite-produced “maps” of the world’s twenty largest cities. With Bosselmann’s guidance, we begin to understand the key elements of urban design. Using Copenhagen, Denmark, as an example, he teaches us to observe without prejudice or bias. He demonstrates how cities transform by introducing the idea of “urban morphology” through an examination of more than a century of transformations in downtown Oakland, California. We learn how to measure quality-of-life parameters that are often considered immeasurable, including “vitality,” “livability,” and “belonging.” Utilizing the street grids of San Francisco as examples, Bosselmann explains how to define urban spaces. Modeling, he reveals, is not so much about creating models as it is about bringing others into public, democratic discussions. Finally, we find out how to interpret essential aspects of “life and place” by evaluating aerial images of the San Francisco Bay Area taken in 1962 and those taken forty-three years later. Bosselmann has a unique understanding of cities and how they “work.” His hope is that, with the fresh vision he offers, readers will be empowered to offer inventive new solutions to familiar urban problems.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T3unRMEvcgwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Urban Transformation');

To make it possible to offer the course early in the curriculum (after differential equations), no knowledge of complex variable theory is assumed. However, since a thorough study of Laplace. transforms requires at least the rudiments of this theory, Chapter 3 includes a brief sketch of complex variables, with many of the details presented in Appendix A.

The rise of the computer is radically altering how human beings receive and process information. Digital environments and virtual reality are adding a third dimension to communication and creating a new visual language. This visionary and thoroughly accessible book examines this entire revolutionary phenomenon and how historians will utilize the new medium of computers and the new language of visualization to transform our understanding of history.

With emerging digital technology, these images will become more sophisticated, manipulable, and multidimensional, and provide historians with new tools and environments to construct historical narratives. Just as the transition from prehistoric cave paintings to the spread of literacy changed how people think and process information, so has -- and will -- the computer.

One Sunday afternoon, as she unloaded the dishwasher, Gretchen Rubin felt hit by a wave of homesickness. Homesick—why? She was standing right in her own kitchen. She felt homesick, she realized, with love for home itself. “Of all the elements of a happy life,” she thought, “my home is the most important.” In a flash, she decided to undertake a new happiness project, and this time, to focus on home. And what did she want from her home? A place that calmed her, and energized her. A place that, by making her feel safe, would free her to take risks. Also, while Rubin wanted to be happier at home, she wanted to appreciate how much happiness was there already. So, starting in September (the new January), Rubin dedicated a school year—September through May—to making her home a place of greater simplicity, comfort, and love. In The Happiness Project, she worked out general theories of happiness. Here she goes deeper on factors that matter for home, such as possessions, marriage, time, and parenthood. How can she control the cubicle in her pocket? How might she spotlight her family’s treasured possessions? And it really was time to replace that dud toaster. Each month, Rubin tackles a different theme as she experiments with concrete, manageable resolutions—and this time, she coaxes her family to try some resolutions, as well. With her signature blend of memoir, science, philosophy, and experimentation, Rubin’s passion for her subject jumps off the page, and reading just a few chapters of this book will inspire readers to find more happiness in their own lives.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OBb3FjDNpEoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Happier at Home');

Patients now legally can write advance directives to govern their treatment decisions at a time of future incapacity, yet in clinical practice their wishes often are ignored. Examining the tension between incompetent patients'' prior wishes and their current best interests as well as other challenges to advance directives, Robert S. Olick offers a comprehensive argument for favoring advance instructions during the dying process. He clarifies widespread confusion about the moral and legal weight of advance directives, and he prescribes changes in law, policy, and practice that would not only ensure that directives count in the care of the dying but also would define narrow instances when directives should not be followed. Olick also presents and develops an original theory of prospective autonomy that recasts and strengthens patient and family control. While focusing largely on philosophical issues the book devotes substantial attention to legal and policy questions and includes case studies throughout.

Drama had been forgotten since the days of ancient Greece, but it reemerged in Elizabethan London with the building of the first modern theater. Its impact can still be imagined today. There were the theaters, open to the weather and featuring neither sets nor curtains, but equipped with dramatic special effects. There were the companies of actors--the leading men, the comedians, the boys who played women''s roles--and the playwrights who gave them all lines to say. Best of all, there was William Shakespeare, who rubbed shoulders with noblemen and royalty as well as with the rowdy crowds at the foot of the stage. He was suspected of involvement in a treasonous rebellion, and his last play literally brought down the house when cannon effects set fire to the famous Globe theater and it burned to the ground.

This is the story of the infamous Dreyfus affair told as a chillingly dark, hard-edged novel of conspiracy and espionage. Paris in 1895. Alfred Dreyfus, a young Jewish officer, has just been convicted of treason, sentenced to life imprisonment at Devil’s Island, and stripped of his rank in front of a baying crowd of twenty-thousand. Among the witnesses to his humiliation is Georges Picquart, the ambitious, intellectual, recently promoted head of the counterespionage agency that “proved” Dreyfus had passed secrets to the Germans. At first, Picquart firmly believes in Dreyfus’s guilt. But it is not long after Dreyfus is delivered to his desolate prison that Picquart stumbles on information that leads him to suspect that there is still a spy at large in the French military. As evidence of the most malignant deceit mounts and spirals inexorably toward the uppermost levels of government, Picquart is compelled to question not only the case against Dreyfus but also his most deeply held beliefs about his country, and about himself. Bringing to life the scandal that mesmerized the world at the turn of the twentieth century, Robert Harris tells a tale of uncanny timeliness––a witch hunt, secret tribunals, out-of-control intelligence agencies, the fate of a whistle-blower--richly dramatized with the singular storytelling mastery that has marked all of his internationally best-selling novels.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-fKvAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'An Officer and a Spy');

Gary Heyward’s life changed forever when he received a letter from the New York City Department of Corrections announcing he was accepted into the academy for new recruits. For the Harlem-born ex-Marine, being an officer of the law was the ticket he’d been waiting for to move up from a low-wage security job and out of the Polo Ground Projects in New York City—and take his mother with him. Heyward was warned of the temptations he’d encounter as a new officer, but when faced with financial hardship, he suddenly found himself unable to resist the income generated from selling contraband to inmates. In his distinctive voice, Heyward takes you on a journey inside the walls of Rikers Island, showing how he teamed up with various inmates and other officers to develop a system that allowed him to profit from selling drugs inside the jail.

And like a broken phone or TV remote, they throw prayer out as unnecessary ''clutter'' in their busy lives. Anne Graham Lotz has found that while prayer does work, sometimes the ''pray-ers'' don''t. So she has turned to the prophet Daniel for help. The Daniel Prayer is born deep within your soul, erupts through your heart, and pours out on your lips - words created by and infused with the Spirit of God, quivering with spiritual electricity. It''s really not an everyday type of prayer. It''s a prayer birthed under pressure, sometimes heartache or grief. It can be triggered by a sudden revelation of hope: an answer to prayer, a promise freshly received, a miracle that lies just over the horizon... This book will help you to pray - effectively - for your nation, for your family, and for yourself. In it, Anne answers such questions as... Does God only hear the prayers of good people? How do I know the God to whom I pray will listen? How do I know God cares about my prayer? How do I know God will answer my prayer? Why should I pray at all? Does it matter where I am when I pray? Are words in prayer all that matter, or does my attitude affect prayer? And most crucial of all - what difference does my prayer actually make?

If so, you aren’t alone. According to a January 2010 report from the U.S. Federal Reserve, there are 609.8 million credit cards held by U.S. consumers, and the average credit card debt per household is $15,519. In the last 12 months, 15 percent of American adults, or nearly 34 million people, have been late making a credit card payment, and 8 percent (18 million people) have missed a payment entirely, according to the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. If these statistics hit home for you, don’t turn to bankruptcy to solve your financial woes. This book will provide you with the tools to legally settle your credit card accounts — without ruining your financial situation for years to come. How to Legally Settle Your Personal Credit Card Debt for Pennies on the Dollar is for everyone who is unable to pay mounting minimum payments on their credit cards. You will learn everything you need to know about the basics of credit card debt, including interest rates, finance charges, minimum payments, and late fees. Discover what actually happens to your credit when you are late making your payments or stop making payments altogether and how long it takes before your credit cards debt is sold to a collection agency. This book will provide tips and strategies for negotiating with your original creditor and collection agencies and sample settlement letters you can use when working with creditors. Equip yourself with proven strategies for legally challenging the validity of your credit card debt and information on how to determine whether your rights are being violated under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. You will find out the advantages of not filing bankruptcy and how to work with credit counselors and avoid debt-reduction scams. Once you have successfully settled your debt and avoided bankruptcy, you will learn how to avoid repeating these mistakes in the future by setting budgets, cutting costs, and lowering interest rates. Learn how the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act, which went into effect in February 2010, affects you as a consumer. While these new rules do not absolve consumers of their obligations, they do mean that credit card companies can no longer retroactively increase rates, charge misleading late fees, or use over-limit fee traps. We have spent hundreds of hours interviewing top financial experts, bill collectors, and individuals just like you who were able to legally settle their credit card debt without resorting to bankruptcy. If you are tired of dodging phone calls from collectors or worrying about how missed payments have ruined your credit score, get yourself back to a more stable financial situation — one where credit card debt is a thing of the past.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B5lUh_vDLQwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'How to Legally Settle Your Personal Credit Card Debt for Pennies on the Dollar');

A bag of chips. That’s all sixteen-year-old Rashad is looking for at the corner bodega. What he finds instead is a fist-happy cop, Paul Galluzzo, who mistakes Rashad for a shoplifter, mistakes Rashad’s pleadings that he’s stolen nothing for belligerence, mistakes Rashad’s resistance to leave the bodega as resisting arrest, mistakes Rashad’s every flinch at every punch the cop throws as further resistance and refusal to STAY STILL as ordered. But how can you stay still when someone is pounding your face into the concrete pavement? But there were witnesses: Quinn Collins—a varsity basketball player and Rashad’s classmate who has been raised by Paul since his own father died in Afghanistan—and a video camera. Soon the beating is all over the news and Paul is getting threatened with accusations of prejudice and racial brutality. Quinn refuses to believe that the man who has basically been his savior could possibly be guilty. But then Rashad is absent. And absent again. And again. And the basketball team—half of whom are Rashad’s best friends—start to take sides. As does the school. And the town. Simmering tensions threaten to explode as Rashad and Quinn are forced to face decisions and consequences they had never considered before. Written in tandem by two award-winning authors, this tour de force shares the alternating perspectives of Rashad and Quinn as the complications from that single violent moment, the type taken from the headlines, unfold and reverberate to highlight an unwelcome truth.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FqzBCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'All American Boys');

With deposits from landowners'' rents and stock sales these bankers practised as moneylenders and money-brokers for another sector of the gentry needing capital to offset the effects of the Great Rebellion and an agricultural depression. After 1660 Clayton and Morris integrated mortgage security into banking practice.

But her newfound independence is short-lived. In Nazi-occupied Paris, Chagall''s status as a Jewish artist has made them all targets, yet his devotion to his art blinds him to their danger. When Ida falls in love and Chagall angrily paints an empty wedding chair (The Bridal Chair) in response, she faces an impossible choice: Does she fight to forge her own path outside her father''s shadow, or abandon her ambitions to save Chagall from his enemies and himself? Brimming with historic personalities from Europe, America and Israel, The Bridal Chair is a stunning portrait of love, fortitude, and the sharp divide between art and real life. "Only Gloria Goldreich could write a novel so grounded in historical truths yet so exuberantly imaginative.

Broodingly handsome, worldly, and charismatic, Dr. Vladimir Dragan is a poet, a self-proclaimed holistic healer, and a welcome disruption to the monotony of village life. Before long, the beautiful black-haired Fidelma McBride falls under his spell and, defying the shackles of wedlock and convention, turns to him to cure her of her deepest pains. Then, one morning, the illusion is abruptly shattered. While en route to pay tribute at Yeats''s grave, Dr. Vlad is arrested and revealed to be a notorious war criminal and mass murderer. The Cloonoila community is devastated by this revelation, and no one more than Fidelma, who is made to pay for her deviance and desire.

Noted historian and anthropologist Raphael Patai, himself a native of Hungary, tells in this pioneering study the fascinating story of the struggles, achievements, and setbacks that marked the flow of history for the Hungarian Jews. He traces their seminal role in Hungarian politics, finance, industry, science, medicine, arts, and literature, and their surprisingly rich contributions to Jewish scholarship and religious leadership both inside Hungary and in the Western world. In the early centuries of their history Hungarian Jews left no written works, so Patai had to piece together a picture of their life up to the sixteenth century based on documents and reports written by non-Jewish Hungarians and visitors from abroad. Once Hungarian Jewish literary activity began, the sources covering the life and work of the Jews rapidly increased in richness. Patai made full use of the wealth of information contained in the monumental eighteen-volume series of the Hungarian Jewish Archives and the other abundant primary sources available in Latin, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Yiddish, and Turkish, the languages in vogue in various periods among the Jews of Hungary. In his presentation of the modern period he also examined the literary reflection of Hungarian Jewish life in the works of Jewish and non-Jewish Hungarian novelists, poets, dramatists, and journalists. Patai''s main focus within the overall history of the Hungarian Jews is their culture and their psychology. Convinced that what is most characteristic of a people is the culture which endows its existence with specific coloration, he devotes special attention to the manifestations of Hungarian Jewish talent in the various cultural fields, most significantly literature, the arts, and scholarship. Based on the available statistical data Patai shows that from the nineteenth century, in all fields of Hungarian culture, Jews played leading roles not duplicated in any other country. Patai also shows that in the Hungarian Jewish culture a specific set of psychological motivations had a highly significant function. The Hungarian national character trait of emphatic patriotism was present in an even more fervent form in the Hungarian Jewish mind. Despite their centuries-old struggle against anti-Semitism, and especially from the nineteenth century on, Hungarian Jews remained convinced that they were one hundred percent Hungarians, differing in nothing but denominational variation from the Catholic and Protestant Hungarians. This mindset kept them apart and isolated from the Jewries of the Western world until overtaken by the tragedy of the Holocaust in the closing months of World War II.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LLuPS1yVDf8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Jews of Hungary');

In comparing the Franco-European Ariane rocket program with the earlier penal experiment, Redfield connects the myth of Robinson Crusoe, nineteenth-century prison reform, the Dreyfus Affair, tropical medicine, postwar exploration of outer space, satellite technology, development, and ecotourism with a focus on place, and the incorporation of this particular place into greater extended systems. Examining the wider context of the Ariane program, he argues that technology and nature must be understood within a greater ecology of displacement and makes a case for the importance of margins in understanding the trajectories of modern life.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=skvfXT-lgLYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Space in the Tropics');

When his father dies, Carl Martin inherits a house in an increasingly rich and trendy London neighborhood. Carl needs cash, however, so he rents the upstairs room and kitchen to the first person he interviews, Dermot McKinnon. That was colossal mistake number one. Mistake number two was keeping his father’s bizarre collection of homeopathic “cures” that he found in the medicine cabinet, including a stash of controversial diet pills. Mistake number three was selling fifty of those diet pills to a friend, who is then found dead. Dermot seizes a nefarious opportunity and begins to blackmail Carl, refusing to pay rent, and creepily invading Carl’s space. Ingeniously weaving together two storylines that finally merge in one shocking turn, Ruth Rendell describes one man’s spiral into darkness—and murder—as he falls victim to a diabolical foe he cannot escape.

There are secrets around every corner in Fayette, Pennsylvania. Tessa left when she was nine and has been trying ever since not to think about what happened there that last summer.

Drama had been forgotten since the days of ancient Greece, but it reemerged in Elizabethan London with the building of the first modern theater. Its impact can still be imagined today. There were the theaters, open to the weather and featuring neither sets nor curtains, but equipped with dramatic special effects. There were the companies of actors--the leading men, the comedians, the boys who played women''s roles--and the playwrights who gave them all lines to say. Best of all, there was William Shakespeare, who rubbed shoulders with noblemen and royalty as well as with the rowdy crowds at the foot of the stage. He was suspected of involvement in a treasonous rebellion, and his last play literally brought down the house when cannon effects set fire to the famous Globe theater and it burned to the ground.

Each chapter is a self-contained introduction ti its particular subject, and makes few specific references to other chapters. Chapters 1 examines the relationship between the molecular and continuum models of the fluid, and between the Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions of the latter. Ch.2 is a broad introduction to the fluid dynamics of rotating, stratified flows. Ch.3 adddresses large-scale ocean circulation. Chs.4,5 and 6 discuss the theory of turbulence, including elementary ideas based on vorticity laws (Ch.4), statistical turbulence theory (Ch.5), and the applications of these ideas to quasigeostrophic flows in the Earth''s oceans and atmosphere (Ch.6). Ch.7 surveys Hamiltonoian fluid dynamics, including the interaction between waves and currents, and "balanced" approximations to nearly geostrophic flow. Overall, the emphasis is on physical ideas rather than mathematical techniques.

Thankfully, in addition to a magnificent literary legacy—which includes seven novels and three co-authored works of nonfiction—Douglas left us something more. The book you are about to enjoy was rescued from his four computers, culled from an archive of chapters from his long-awaited novel-in-progress, as well as his short stories, speeches, articles, interviews, and letters. In a way that none of his previous books could, The Salmon of Doubt provides the full, dazzling, laugh-out-loud experience of a journey through the galaxy as perceived by Douglas Adams. From a boy’s first love letter (to his favorite science fiction magazine) to the distinction of possessing a nose of heroic proportions; from climbing Kilimanjaro in a rhino costume to explaining why Americans can’t make a decent cup of tea; from lyrical tributes to the sublime pleasures found in music by Procol Harum, the Beatles, and Bach to the follies of his hopeless infatuation with technology; from fantastic, fictional forays into the private life of Genghis Khan to extended visits with Dirk Gently and Zaphod Beeblebrox: this is the vista from the elevated perch of one of the tallest, funniest, most brilliant, and most penetrating social critics and thinkers of our time.

In studying the natural and human forces that shape the rivers and mountains of that region, geologist David Montgomery has learned to see the evolution and near-extinction of the salmon as a story of changing landscapes. Montgomery shows how a succession of historical experiences -first in the United Kingdom, then in New England, and now in the Pacific Northwest -repeat a disheartening story in which overfishing and sweeping changes to rivers and seas render the world inhospitable to salmon. In King of Fish, Montgomery traces the human impacts on salmon over the last thousand years and examines the implications both for salmon recovery efforts and for the more general problem of human impacts on the natural world. What does it say for the long-term prospects of the world''s many endangered species if one of the most prosperous regions of the richest country on earth cannot accommodate its icon species?

The country, faced with a considerable backlog of approved but unmet applications for foreign currencies, tolerated a parallel market. Street traders, however, demanded only negligible premiums (if any at all) for foreign exchange. By integrating the emigrants’ transfer decisions into a basic Mundell-Fleming-type model, the author conjectures that this puzzle can be explained with the increasing use of transfer channels outside the banking system, leading to unrecorded inflows of foreign exchange. Analysis of the relevant balance of payments data appears to support this result.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TGv7bMpVl8sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Foreign Exchange Queues, Informal Traders, and a Zero Premium in the Black Market');

It focusses upon how soft law fits into the Community legal system, and how it is used, and, in particular, how it relates to Community legislation.Differentiation of the Community instruments, including the instruments of soft law, is often thought to enhance the effectiveness, legitimacy and transparency of the Community. This book asks whether soft law indeed provides a satisfactory alternative to legislation from this perspective and, if so, in what cases and under what conditions. Furthermore, the author asks to what extent the use of soft law implies good governance, and throws fresh light on this very heterogenous phenomenon, by looking at frequently used instruments in many different areas of Community law, such as competition law, state aid, environment, social policy etc., in the process identifying their different characteristics, aims, functions and legal effects. What emerges is that the conditions under which soft law is used may be problematic in relation to increasing the legitimacy, effectiveness and transparency of Community action.This is a work which will interest legal practitioners confronted with the use of soft law and the question of its possible legal effect in an increasing number of sectors and academics interested in the vexed question of how the increased use of soft law can be justified in a Community legal order built upon the rule of law. It is also critical of developments taking place within the framework of the European Convention and the proposed European Constitution, and goes beyond the immediate problems of soft law to touch upon issues such as competence, legal protection, division of powers between the EC and the Member States, institutional balance, lawmaking by the Community Courts, the scope of Community legal principles and the influence of soft law on the progressive development of both Community and national law.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B9Z82q_LXzwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Soft Law in European Community Law');

It is now used frequently—and often incorrectly—by political leaders, editorial writers, and academics around the world. So what is soft power? Soft power lies in the ability to attract and persuade. Whereas hard power—the ability to coerce—grows out of a country''s military or economic might, soft power arises from the attractiveness of a country''s culture, political ideals, and policies. Hard power remains crucial in a world of states trying to guard their independence and of non-state groups willing to turn to violence. It forms the core of the Bush administration''s new national security strategy. But according to Nye, the neo-conservatives who advise the president are making a major miscalculation: They focus too heavily on using America''s military power to force other nations to do our will, and they pay too little heed to our soft power. It is soft power that will help prevent terrorists from recruiting supporters from among the moderate majority. And it is soft power that will help us deal with critical global issues that require multilateral cooperation among states. That is why it is so essential that America better understands and applies our soft power.

In China, soft power has become one of the most frequently used phrases among political leaders, leading academics, and journalists. Defined against hard power, which often involves threat and coercion, soft power applies attraction, persuasion, and cooperation, finding its sources in culture, political values, and foreign policies. China, rich in culture and traditional philosophy, boasts abundant sources of soft power. Soft Power attempts to analyze the domestic and international views of China''s soft power, the main strengths and weaknesses of China''s soft power, and the application of soft power in China''s international politics. It provides a comprehensive exploration of the soft power dimension in China''s foreign relations by integrating views from various disciplines, such as history, education, culture, political economy, comparative politics, and philosophy. The book argues that soft power has become a very popular concept in China, that China is contemplating and exploring an innovative strategy in its rise and international politics, and that there have been quite a few notable elements of this in China''s diplomatic practice, including softer rhetoric, promotion of the Chinese culture abroad, economic diplomacy, and image building. The book also argues that the limitations of China''s soft power primarily stem from political values and China''s own transitions, and reflects the reality that views and opinions regarding China''s soft power are fairly diverse both in China and in the international arena.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_6Oqbe6W9C0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Soft Power');

Perhaps also it has always been political. In recent years, however, it has become something else besides: economic. Nowadays a lot of money is invested in sport, and sporting competitions often generate enormous amounts of revenue. This has entailed serious repercussions, especially for the relations between individual sportsmen/sportswomen and the sporting clubs and federations that act as brokers for their careers. Into this protected area for decades a closed shop now come the European institutions, especially the European Court of Justice and the European Commission, with the declared intention of ensuring respect for the exigencies of Community law while at the same time protecting the specificity and the integrity of sport. This important book presents an in-depth analysis of the viability under Community law of traditional sports regulations such as transfer rules and nationality clausesboth sets of rules seriously compromised by the Bosman case of 1995. The author asks in particular whether certain rules elaborated by sporting associations can withstand the test of compatibility with the free movement provisions of the EC Treaty. In the light of Bosman, he also rigorously investigates: whether valuable arguments exist for keeping certain sporting rules and practices entirely outside the scope of the EC Treaty; and whether the private nature of sporting clubs constitutes a stumbling block for the application of the relevant free movement rules. Practical Regulation of the Mobility of Sportsmen in the EU Post Bosman comes at a moment when clarification of where this complex and contentious matter currently lies is essential if we are to gauge where it is going. The topic is of special and increasing interest, as official declarations on sport were attached to the Treaties of both Amsterdam and Nice. And, if the draft Constitution for Europe actually enters into force, sport will even become an official area of Union policy. This trend confirms the value and significance of this ground-breaking book for practitioners, policymakers, and regulators in the burgeoning field of sports law.

Mann vividly evokes the atmosphere of Streisand’s New York.”—New York Times In 1960, Barbra Streisand was just a seventeen-year-old Brooklyn kid with plenty of talent but no connections and certainly no money; her mother brought her soup to make sure she stayed fed as she took acting classes and scraped out a living. Just four years later, she was the top-selling female recording artist in America and the star of one of Broadway’s biggest hits. In Hello, Gorgeous, the acclaimed Hollywood biographer William Mann chronicles that dizzying ascent, telling the riveting behind-the-scenes story of how Streisand and her team transformed her from an unknown dreamer into one of the world’s most beloved superstars. “Trying to figure out the Barbra Streisand mystique is no easy task, but author William Mann expertly captures the launch of her remarkable career in the early 1960s when a unique ‘star was born’ . . . Mann''s meticulous research and insightful analysis go deeper than any previous biography: shedding light on the formative years that shaped Streisand''s persona, debunking some myths . . . and providing a cultural snapshot of the wild and free-spirited era in which Streisand blossomed.”—USA Today “In his masterful book, Mann captures one of the most fully realized pictures of the multi-hyphenate superstar to date . . .

Many of these ideas, which arose in other fields of study, are interpreted architecturally, in order to help designers leverage them in the creative act. By showing how the key concepts work together to define a coherent view of architecture, Feedback Loop supports the conclusion that the pursuit of complexity is poised to expand beyond the avant-garde to become a broad-scoped, long-term architectural movement.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UyBqTytHjpsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Feedback Loop');

Stalenhag s paintings and stories take place in an alternate version of Sweden in the 80s and 90s, primarily in the countryside of Malaroarna, a string of islands just west of Stockholm, and how this reality came about: the development of the Loop, a large particle accelerator and the side effects of the massive project.

Henry Shackleford is a young slave living in the Kansas Territory in 1857, when the region is a battleground between anti- and pro-slavery forces. When John Brown, the legendary abolitionist, arrives in the area, an argument between Brown and Henry’s master quickly turns violent. Henry is forced to leave town—with Brown, who believes he’s a girl. Over the ensuing months, Henry—whom Brown nicknames Little Onion—conceals his true identity as he struggles to stay alive. Eventually Little Onion finds himself with Brown at the historic raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859—one of the great catalysts for the Civil War. An absorbing mixture of history and imagination, and told with McBride’s meticulous eye for detail and character, The Good Lord Bird is both a rousing adventure and a moving exploration of identity and survival.

Robin Coste Lewis’s electrifying collection is a triptych that begins and ends with lyric poems considering the roles desire and race play in the construction of the self. The central panel is the title poem, “Voyage of the Sable Venus,” a riveting narrative made up entirely of titles of artworks from ancient times to the present—titles that feature or in some way comment on the black female figure in Western art. Bracketed by Lewis’s autobiographical poems, “Voyage” is a tender and shocking study of the fragmentary mysteries of stereotype, as it juxtaposes our names for things with what we actually see and know. Offering a new understanding of biography and the self, this collection questions just where, historically, do ideas about the black female figure truly begin—five hundred years ago, five thousand, or even longer? And what role has art played in this ancient, often heinous story? From the “Young Black Female Carrying / a Perfume Vase” to a “Little Brown Girl / Girl Standing in a Tree / First Day of Voluntary / School Integration,” this poet adores her culture and the beauty to be found within it. Yet she is also a cultural critic alert to the nuances of race and desire and how they define us all, including herself, as she explores her own sometimes painful history. Lewis’s book is a thrilling aesthetic anthem to the complexity of race—a full embrace of its pleasure and horror, in equal parts.

In Tremble for My Country, Coates takes readers along on his journey through America''s history of race and its contemporary resonances through a series of awakenings -- moments when he discovered some new truth about our long, tangled history of race, whether through his myth-busting professors at Howard University, a trip to a Civil War battlefield with a rogue historian, a journey to Chicago''s South Side to visit aging survivors of 20th century America''s ''long war on black people,'' or a visit with the mother of a beloved friend who was shot down by the police.

Patti Smith would evolve as a poet and performer, and Robert Mapplethorpe would direct his highly provocative style toward photography. Bound in innocence and enthusiasm, they traversed the city from Coney Island to Forty-second Street, and eventually to the celebrated round table of Max''s Kansas City, where the Andy Warhol contingent held court. In 1969, the pair set up camp at the Hotel Chelsea and soon entered a community of the famous and infamous—the influential artists of the day and the colorful fringe. It was a time of heightened awareness, when the worlds of poetry, rock and roll, art, and sexual politics were colliding and exploding. In this milieu, two kids made a pact to take care of each other. Scrappy, romantic, committed to create, and fueled by their mutual dreams and drives, they would prod and provide for one another during the hungry years. Just Kids begins as a love story and ends as an elegy. It serves as a salute to New York City during the late sixties and seventies and to its rich and poor, its hustlers and hellions.

Interwoven with themes of brutality and faith, guilt and fear, helplessness and survival, the characters in these stories struggle to make meaning out of chaos. In "Redeployment", a soldier who has had to shoot dogs because they were eating human corpses must learn what it is like to return to domestic life in suburbia, surrounded by people "who have no idea where Fallujah is, where three members of your platoon died." In "After Action Report", a Lance Corporal seeks expiation for a killing he didn''t commit, in order that his best friend will be unburdened. A Morturary Affairs Marine tells about his experiences collecting remains—of U.S. and Iraqi soldiers both. A chaplain sees his understanding of Christianity, and his ability to provide solace through religion, tested by the actions of a ferocious Colonel. And in the darkly comic "Money as a Weapons System", a young Foreign Service Officer is given the absurd task of helping Iraqis improve their lives by teaching them to play baseball. These stories reveal the intricate combination of monotony, bureaucracy, comradeship and violence that make up a soldier''s daily life at war, and the isolation, remorse, and despair that can accompany a soldier''s homecoming. Redeployment is poised to become a classic in the tradition of war writing. Across nations and continents, Klay sets in devastating relief the two worlds a soldier inhabits: one of extremes and one of loss. Written with a hard-eyed realism and stunning emotional depth, this work marks Phil Klay as one of the most talented new voices of his generation.

National Security and Double Government offers a disquieting answer. Michael J. Glennon challenges the myth that U.S. security policy is still forged by America''s visible, "Madisonian institutions" - the President, Congress, and the courts. Their roles, he argues, have become largely illusory. Presidential control is now nominal, congressional oversight is dysfunctional, and judicial review is negligible. The book details the dramatic shift in power that has occurred from the Madisonian institutions to a concealed "Trumanite network" - the several hundred managers of the military, intelligence, diplomatic, and law enforcement agencies who are responsible for protecting the nation and who have come to operate largely immune from constitutional and electoral restraints. Reform efforts face daunting obstacles. Remedies within this new system of "double government" require the hollowed-out Madisonian institutions to exercise the very power that they lack. Meanwhile, reform initiatives from without confront the same pervasive political ignorance within the polity that has given rise to this duality. The book sounds a powerful warning about the need to resolve this dilemma-and the mortal threat posed to accountability, democracy, and personal freedom if double government persists.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1_1-BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'National Security and Double Government');

Many writers have understood colonial rule as either "direct" (French) or "indirect" (British), with a third variant--apartheid--as exceptional. This benign terminology, Mamdani shows, masks the fact that these were actually variants of a despotism. While direct rule denied rights to subjects on racial grounds, indirect rule incorporated them into a "customary" mode of rule, with state-appointed Native Authorities defining custom. By tapping authoritarian possibilities in culture, and by giving culture an authoritarian bent, indirect rule (decentralized despotism) set the pace for Africa; the French followed suit by changing from direct to indirect administration, while apartheid emerged relatively later. Apartheid, Mamdani shows, was actually the generic form of the colonial state in Africa. Through case studies of rural (Uganda) and urban (South Africa) resistance movements, we learn how these institutional features fragment resistance and how states tend to play off reform in one sector against repression in the other. Reforming a power that institutionally enforces tension between town and country, and between ethnicities, is the key challenge for anyone interested in democratic reform in Africa.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4X74KEphsHsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Citizen and Subject');

The ontology is an explicit conceptual model with formal logic-based semantics. Its descriptions may therefore be queried, may foresight required actions, or may be checked to avoid inconsistent system configurations.

It is also a state that has played—and continues to play—an important role in the production of American literature. To qualify for inclusion, a work or a significant part of it has to be set in Michigan.

However, such an approach can neglect the powerful influences exerted upon the state by social and economic forces. This important and controversial new book examines the way in which one of these forces, capital, has emerged in the past two decades as a major influence upon the state, its officials and policies. The emergence of the capitalist class is examined, along with its internal divisions and conflicts and its relations with the state. In particular, attention is given to the fusion of the ruling strata of state officials and the capitalist class the potential basis for a new ruling class. This is set against the weakness of capital caused by its division into domestic and international, state and private, Chinese and indigenous. These factors are in turn set in the context of international influences the rise and fall of the oil boom, the activities of the IBRD and IMF, the decline of export earnings and the fiscal difficulties of the state.

Using two different but contemporary approaches, the authors show what can be learned about Indonesia through use of the Western concepts of "culture" and "politics." Professors Lev, Liddle, and Sartono illustrate how much can be gained from presenting Indonesian life in Western terms, while Professors Abdullah and Anderson contrast Indonesian and Western ideas.

It then applies rigorous mathematical methods to contexts, examines basic sensor data fusion theory and applies it to the contextual fusion of information, and describes the means to distribute contextual information. The authors also illustrate a new type of data repository model to manage contextual data, before concluding with the requirements of contextual security in a global environment.

Researchers from diverse fields of science have taken an interest in these bacterial toxins; they are studied, for example, by microbiologists, biochemists, cell biologists, and pharmacologists. There are two principal reasons for the broad and still growing interest in ADP ribosylating toxins. First, insights into the structure and functions of the toxins might be the key to prevention and treatment of diseases caused by the toxin-producing infectious micro organisms. Second, the ADP-ribosylating toxins provide potent and often unique pharmacological tools for the study of the physiological functions of their target proteins. The latter is especially the case with cholera and pertussis toxins, which both modify the IX-subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. These toxins have proved invaluable in extending our basic understanding of the regulation of hormone-controlled signal transduction. This volume provides a review and an update of recent studies on the basic properties of bacterial ADP-ribosylating tbxins and/or exoenzymes. Our current knowledge of the cel lular entry mechanisms of ADP-ribosylating toxins is reviewed by MADSHUS and STENMARK. WILSON and COLLIER then deal with recent insights into the enzyme mechanism and active site structure of diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, which modify elongation factor 2. Toxins which ADP-ribosylate heterotrimeric G-proteins involved in trans membrane signal transduction are the subject of the next two chapters.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xlXoCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'ADP-Ribosylating Toxins');

A wide range of physiological functions are now known to be mediated by them in cells spanning three biological kingdoms from protist, plant to animal. This is the first book devoted entirely to the field. The story behind the emergence of the field is told and followed by comprehensive reviews of the enzymology, regulations and gene structures of ADP-ribosyl cyclases responsible for metabolizing cADPR and NAADP.

Add in the challenge of cross-cultural differences, cultural collision occurs leading to worse negotiation outcomes in intercultural negotiation than intracultural ones (e.g., Adair et al., 2001; Adair et al., 2007). Given that intercultural negotiations are both challenging and prevalent, this study investigates how to improve intercultural negotiation effectiveness, and demonstrates when intercultural negotiators can in fact achieve significantly better outcomes than intracultural negotiators (i.e. cultural synergy). Drawing insights from research on cultural essentialism and its influence on intergroup relations and conflicts, I examine the interaction between essentialist beliefs and the cultural context in negotiation. Using an actor-partner interdependence model, I reveal that whether cultures collide or synergize in intercultural negotiation depends on negotiators'' endorsement of cultural essentialist beliefs. Intercultural negotiators who believed that cultural characteristics are malleable (i.e. non-essentialist beliefs) achieved higher individual gains and joint gains, compared to not only intercultural negotiators who endorsed stronger essentialist beliefs, but also intracultural negotiators. Beyond identifying why cultures collide in negotiation, these findings pave the way for future research to examine factors that help negotiators harvest cultural synergy for favorable negotiation outcomes.', DEFAULT, 'When Cultures Collide and Synergize');

Covey’s proven 7 Habits to create a leadership program for kids of all ages so they can be more effective, more goal oriented, and more successful In today’s world, we are inundated with information about who to be, what to do, and how to live. But what if there was a way to learn not just what to think about, but how to think? A program that taught how to manage priorities, focus on goals, and be a positive influence? The Leader in Me is that program. In this bestseller, Stephen R. Covey took the 7 Habits that have already changed the lives of millions of readers and showed how even young children can use them as they develop. These habits—be proactive, begin with the end in mind, put first things first, think win-win, seek to understand and then to be understood, synergize, and sharpen the saw—are being adapted by schools around the country in leadership programs, most famously at the A.B Combs Elementary school in Raleigh. Not only does it work, but it works better than anyone could have imaged. This book is full of examples of how the students blossom under the program—the classroom that decided to form a support group for one of their classmates who had behavioral problems, the fourth grader who found a way to overcome his fear of public speaking and wound up taking his class to see him compete in a national story telling competitive, or the seven-year-old who told her father than they needed to go outside and play because they both needed to “sharpen the saw.” Perfect for individuals and corporations alike, The Leader in Me shows how easy it is to incorporate these skills into daily life.

But a century into our love affair with plastic, we’re starting to realize it’s not such a healthy relationship.

As journalist Susan Freinkel points out in this engaging and eye-opening book, we’re nearing a crisis point. We’ve produced as much plastic in the past decade as we did in the entire twentieth century. We’re drowning in the stuff, and we need to start making some hard choices. Freinkel gives us the tools we need with a blend of lively anecdotes and analysis. She combs through scientific studies and economic data, reporting from China and across the United States to assess the real impact of plastic on our lives. She tells her story through eight familiar plastic objects: comb, chair, Frisbee, IV bag, disposable lighter, grocery bag, soda bottle, and credit card.

In SAP you can verify invoices against purchase orders and goods receipts. SAP provides important functionalities like automatic account determination, financial posting, etc. SAP is powerful software that can meet the needs of any business scenario for any type of business in any part of the world. Its all encompassing nature makes SAP complex. In order to derive maximum benefit for business, SAP must be understood well. Mr. Agrawal attempts to explain SAP completely; a seemingly impossible task. This is his third book on the Materials Management module; his first two books in the Materials Management module are ‘Purchasing’ and ‘Inventory Management’. In this book, like in his earlier books, he explains every screen of SAP MM Invoice Verification. Both the SAP Menu and Customizing Implementation Guide are expanded and the chapter number where they are covered is indicated. This not only creates a direct link between the book and the SAP software, but also ensures that the book is comprehensive. The author has taken care to balance details with overviews that explain linkages between concepts. The book is organized in chapters that are important business activities. Each chapter covers business processes carried out in SAP by the user as well as its related configuration. This book can be used to learn SAP from scratch; it is a learning guide. It is, therefore, useful to persons who are training to be SAP Consultants. Having learnt SAP with the help of this book, the Consultant keeps returning to refer to it. In implementation of SAP, Consultants prepare User Manual. With the availability of this book, their task becomes simpler. In the User Manual, they need to cover only implementation specific points. The user refers to this book as a generic User Manual. As the user gains knowledge he also begins to understand the customizing settings for his implementation.

Adding to the confusion is the fact that it falls between two teams the MM team and the FI team and each assumes that the other is responsible for the design and configuration of Invoice Verification. Although the process can be streamlined, many organizations get the design and use of invoice verification wrong, resulting in vendors not being paid and accounts being placed on stop, which prevents further Purchase Orders from being processed until the vendor has been paid. The aim of this book is to help readers fully understand the invoice verification process, particularly the changes in ERP 6.0. If they get the design right, then the process will run smoothly and vendors will be paid on time (not too early either). User input can be kept to a minimum and much of the process can be automatic. There are one or two basic mistakes that are made during the design of the process and the guide highlights these (and many other confusing areas), and describes, in simple terms, the options available along with the consequences of getting it wrong. Stephen Birchall has more than 34 years of IT consulting experience and has spent the last 24 years as a SAP consultant. Stephen has expansive knowledge of SAP systems and modules, his primary area of expertise is SAP MM and AP processes. Stephen worked as a Lead Logistics Trainer at the SAP UK training center for 4 years, delivering a wide spectrum of SAP logistics courses including Invoice Verification / AP courses. In each of those 4 years 1995/6/7 and 8 SAP identified Stephen as the highest rated SAP trainer in the UK. While at the training center in the UK, Stephen single-handedly delivered the 5 week MM Academy ten times, back-to-back and loved every minute of it! Mr. Birchall was asked by SAP AG to write some additional exam questions for SAP''s MM exam. Stephen''s enthusiasm for SAP software is based on his first-hand experience of its capabilities on various projects at several major organizations, including several assignments for Deloitte, Accenture, SAP and HCL Axon.

He visited some of the toughest places in the world—from refugee camps of Congo to Syrian war zones. From phone-charger stands in Rwanda to R&D labs in South Korea, Ross has seen what the future holds. Over the past two decades, the Internet has radically changed markets and businesses worldwide. InThe Industries of the Future, Ross shows us what''s next, highlighting the best opportunities for progress and explaining why countries thrive or sputter. He examines the specific fields that will most shape our economic future over the next ten years, including cybercrime and cybersecurity, the commercialization of genomics, the next step for big data, and the coming impact of digital technology on money, payments, and markets. And in each of these realms, Ross addresses the toughest questions: How will we have to adapt to the changing nature of work? Is the prospect of cyberwar sparking the next arms race? How can the world''s rising nations hope to match Silicon Valley in creating their own innovation hotspots? Ross blends storytelling and economic analysis to give a vivid and informed perspective on how sweeping global trends are affecting the ways we live, incorporating the insights of leaders ranging from the founders of Google and Twitter to defense experts like David Petraeus.

For the first time, such a configurable processor array architecture consisting of locally interconnected VLIW processing elements can be claimed by programs, either in full or in part, using the principle of invasive computing. Invasive TCPAs provide unprecedented energy efficiency for the parallel execution of nested loop programs by avoiding any global memory access such as GPUs and may even support loops with complex dependencies such as loop-carried dependencies that are not amenable to parallel execution on GPUs. For this purpose, the book proposes different invasion strategies for claiming a desired number of processing elements (PEs) or region within a TCPA exclusively for an application according to performance requirements. It not only presents models for implementing invasion strategies in hardware, but also proposes two distinct design flavors for dedicated hardware components to support invasion control on TCPAs.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RTemDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Invasive Tightly Coupled Processor Arrays');

In a series of wide-ranging critical essays, marked by authoritative and innovative perspectives, the volume explores the shifting technologies, theories, and practices of colour in cinema, highlighting the intricate relationship between technological, philosophical, and artistic concerns, and making a compelling case for colour as a dominant and complex signifier in filmic discourse.

Using an innovative grassroots and public awareness methodology, the initiative mobilized the local business community to bulldoze barriers by identifying concrete legislative changes and advocating for their adoption and implementation. By delivering fast results--50 reforms in 150 days--the initiative won the confidence of entrepreneurs and empowered them to institutionalize permanent grassroots reform committees. The force of this lobby group created political will by putting public pressure on the politicians to do their part to enact the reforms. Most important, it carried investment climate reform the last mile by delivering concrete, quantifiable results in all sectors of the economy. Over time, the initiative is establishing a dynamic of reform and public-private partnership that will facilitate the tackling of more complicated structural reforms. Complementing the systemic approach and framework reform efforts of governments and international agencies, competitiveness partnerships mobilize the local business community to catalog concrete problems across the full spectrum of investment climate concerns, pinpoint solutions, campaign for their adoption, and follow up on reform implementation. The author attempts to determine the applicability of competitiveness partnerships to different settings by modeling the interactions between several key success factors, thus providing a pertinent tool for development professionals, government officials, and private sector advocates who wish to establish a renewed implementation dynamic through this kind of results-oriented reform process.

While CSS is a relatively simple technology to learn, it is a difficult one to master. When you first start developing sites using CSS, you will come across all kinds of infuriating browser bugs and inconsistencies. It sometimes feels like there are a million and one different techniques to master, spread across a bewildering array of websites. The range of possibilities seems endless and makes for a steep and daunting learning curve. By bringing all of the latest tips, tricks, and techniques together in one handy reference, this book demystifies the secrets of CSS and makes the journey to CSS mastery as simple and painless as possible. While most books concentrate on basic skills, this one is different, assuming that you already know the basics and why you should be using CSS in your work, and concentrating mainly on advanced techniques. It begins with a brief recap of CSS fundamentals such as the importance of meaningful markup, how to structure and maintain your code, and how the CSS layout model really works. With the basics out of the way, each subsequent chapter details a particular aspect of CSS-based design. Through a series of easy-to-follow tutorials, you will learn practical CSS techniques you can immediately start using in your daily work. Browser inconsistencies are the thorn in most CSS developers'' sides, so we have dedicated two whole chapters to CSS hacks, filters, and bug fixing, as well as looking at image replacement; professional link, form, and list styling; pure CSS layouts; and much more.

Featuring mundane subjects photographed prosaically, with idiosyncratically deadpan titles, these "small books" were sought after, collected, and loved by Ruscha''s fans and fellow artists. Over the past thirty years, close to 100 other small books that appropriated or paid homage to Ruscha''s have appeared throughout the world. This book collects ninety-one of these projects, showcasing the cover and sample layouts from each along with a description of the work. It also includes selections from Ruscha''s books and an appendix listing all known Ruscha book tributes. These small books revisit, imitate, honor, and parody Ruscha in form, content, and title. Some rephotograph his subjects: Thirtyfour Parking Lots, Forty Years Later. Some offer a humorous variation: Various Unbaked Cookies (which concludes, as did Ruscha''s Various Small Fires, with a glass of milk), Twentynine Palms (twenty-nine photographs of palm-readers'' signs). Some say something different: None of the Buildings on Sunset Strip. Some reach for a connection with Ruscha himself: 17 Parked Cars in Various Parking Lots Along Pacific Coast Highway Between My House and Ed Ruscha''s.

Using Gregory Bateson''s philosophy of mind and a Geertzian thick description of a typical concert in a typical symphony hall, Small demonstrates how musicking forms a ritual through which all the participants explore and celebrate the relationships that constitute their social identity.

And yet as the years pass, Stoner encounters a succession of disappointments: marriage into a “proper” family estranges him from his parents; his career is stymied; his wife and daughter turn coldly away from him; a transforming experience of new love ends under threat of scandal. Driven ever deeper within himself, Stoner rediscovers the stoic silence of his forebears and confronts an essential solitude. John Williams’s luminous and deeply moving novel is a work of quiet perfection.

The photos he took and the accompanying interviews became the blog Humans of New York. In the first three years, his audience steadily grew from a few hundred to over one million. In 2013, his book Humans of New York, based on that blog, was published and immediately catapulted to the top of the NY Times Bestseller List. Ever since Brandon began interviewing people on the streets of NY, the dialogue he''s had with them has increasingly become as in-depth, intriguing and moving as the photos themselves.

So she has turned to the prophet Daniel for help. The Daniel Prayer is born deep within your soul, erupts through your heart, and pours out on your lips - words created by and infused with the Spirit of God, quivering with spiritual electricity. It''s really not an everyday type of prayer. It''s a prayer birthed under pressure, sometimes heartache or grief. It can be triggered by a sudden revelation of hope: an answer to prayer, a promise freshly received, a miracle that lies just over the horizon... This book will help you to pray - effectively - for your nation, for your family, and for yourself. In it, Anne answers such questions as... Does God only hear the prayers of good people? How do I know the God to whom I pray will listen? How do I know God cares about my prayer? How do I know God will answer my prayer? Why should I pray at all? Does it matter where I am when I pray? Are words in prayer all that matter, or does my attitude affect prayer? And most crucial of all - what difference does my prayer actually make?

If so, you aren’t alone. According to a January 2010 report from the U.S. Federal Reserve, there are 609.8 million credit cards held by U.S. consumers, and the average credit card debt per household is $15,519. In the last 12 months, 15 percent of American adults, or nearly 34 million people, have been late making a credit card payment, and 8 percent (18 million people) have missed a payment entirely, according to the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. If these statistics hit home for you, don’t turn to bankruptcy to solve your financial woes. This book will provide you with the tools to legally settle your credit card accounts — without ruining your financial situation for years to come. How to Legally Settle Your Personal Credit Card Debt for Pennies on the Dollar is for everyone who is unable to pay mounting minimum payments on their credit cards. You will learn everything you need to know about the basics of credit card debt, including interest rates, finance charges, minimum payments, and late fees. Discover what actually happens to your credit when you are late making your payments or stop making payments altogether and how long it takes before your credit cards debt is sold to a collection agency. This book will provide tips and strategies for negotiating with your original creditor and collection agencies and sample settlement letters you can use when working with creditors. Equip yourself with proven strategies for legally challenging the validity of your credit card debt and information on how to determine whether your rights are being violated under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. You will find out the advantages of not filing bankruptcy and how to work with credit counselors and avoid debt-reduction scams. Once you have successfully settled your debt and avoided bankruptcy, you will learn how to avoid repeating these mistakes in the future by setting budgets, cutting costs, and lowering interest rates. Learn how the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act, which went into effect in February 2010, affects you as a consumer. While these new rules do not absolve consumers of their obligations, they do mean that credit card companies can no longer retroactively increase rates, charge misleading late fees, or use over-limit fee traps. We have spent hundreds of hours interviewing top financial experts, bill collectors, and individuals just like you who were able to legally settle their credit card debt without resorting to bankruptcy. If you are tired of dodging phone calls from collectors or worrying about how missed payments have ruined your credit score, get yourself back to a more stable financial situation — one where credit card debt is a thing of the past.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B5lUh_vDLQwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'How to Legally Settle Your Personal Credit Card Debt for Pennies on the Dollar');

But a century into our love affair with plastic, we’re starting to realize it’s not such a healthy relationship. Plastics draw on dwindling fossil fuels, leach harmful chemicals, litter landscapes, and destroy marine life. As journalist Susan Freinkel points out in this engaging and eye-opening book, we’re nearing a crisis point. We’ve produced as much plastic in the past decade as we did in the entire twentieth century. We’re drowning in the stuff, and we need to start making some hard choices. Freinkel gives us the tools we need with a blend of lively anecdotes and analysis. She combs through scientific studies and economic data, reporting from China and across the United States to assess the real impact of plastic on our lives. She tells her story through eight familiar plastic objects: comb, chair, Frisbee, IV bag, disposable lighter, grocery bag, soda bottle, and credit card. Her conclusion: we cannot stay on our plastic-paved path. And we don’t have to. Plastic points the way toward a new creative partnership with the material we love to hate but can’t seem to live without.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9LyGHqqIKT4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Plastic');

Sticky Marketing takes into account these fundamental changes and provides a new set of rules for effective communications in a world transformed by new technology. It introduces a new model of customer engagement and asks ''not what your marketing can do for you, but what your marketing can do for your customer''. Companies have to move away from the old marketing system of shouting messages at people to attracting them by providing value around their product or service - in other words by becoming ''sticky'' or attractive. Grant Leboff argues that it is not ''return on investment'' that matters but ''return on engagement'', not your unique sales point (or USP), but your customer engagement point (your CEP), that will make the difference in today''s cluttered marketplace. Sticky Marketing proves that marketing should now be about value creation if you want to truly engage with your customers. It is only by providing value that you can win the battle for customer attention - stop shouting and start a conversation.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FK_rmlxf4OoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Sticky Marketing');

This new collection continues the tradition, reviewing not only movies that were at the bottom of the barrel, but also movies that he found underneath the barrel. From Roger''s review of Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo (0 stars): "The movie created a spot of controversy in February 2005. According to a story by Larry Carroll of MTV News, Rob Schneider took offense when Patrick Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times listed this year''s Best Picture nominees and wrote that they were ''ignored, unloved, and turned down flat by most of the same studios that . . . bankroll hundreds of sequels, including a follow-up to Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, a film that was sadly overlooked at Oscar time because apparently nobody had the foresight to invent a category for Best Running Penis Joke Delivered by a Third-Rate Comic.'' Schneider retaliated by attacking Goldstein in full-page ads in Daily Variety and the Hollywood Reporter. In an open letter to Goldstein, Schneider wrote: ''Well, Mr. Goldstein, I decided to do some research to find out what awards you have won. I went online and found that you have won nothing. Absolutely nothing. No journalistic awards of any kind. . . . Maybe you didn''t win a Pulitzer Prize because they haven''t invented a category for Best Third-Rate, Unfunny Pompous Reporter Who''s Never Been Acknowledged by His Peers. . . .'' Schneider was nominated for a 2000 Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actor, but lost to Jar-Jar Binks. But Schneider is correct, and Patrick Goldstein has not yet won a Pulitzer Prize. Therefore, Goldstein is not qualified to complain that Columbia financed Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo while passing on the opportunity to participate in Million Dollar Baby, Ray, The Aviator, Sideways, and Finding Neverland. As chance would have it, I have won the Pulitzer Prize, and so I am qualified.

The danger they face will forever reshape their lives and the price they pay for their actions will not only affect themselves, but could possibly shake the foundations of an entire nation. The book is divided into two parts. The first part, entitled "The V3rb0t3n Network," continues the fictional story of Bob and Leon, two hackers caught up in an adventure in which they learn the deadly consequence of digital actions. The second part, "Security Threats Are Real" (STAR), focuses on these real-world lessons and advanced techniques, as used by characters in the story. This gives the reader not only textbook knowledge, but real-world context around how cyber-attacks may manifest. "The V3rb0t3n Network" can be read as a stand-alone story or as an illustration of the issues described in STAR. Scattered throughout "The V3rb0t3n Network" are "Easter eggs"—references, hints, phrases, and more that will lead readers to insights into hacker culture. Drawing on "The V3rb0t3n Network," STAR explains the various aspects of reconnaissance; the scanning phase of an attack; the attacker’s search for network weaknesses and vulnerabilities to exploit; the various angles of attack used by the characters in the story; basic methods of erasing information and obscuring an attacker’s presence on a computer system; and the underlying hacking culture.

But it always seemed like a fleeting whim, a funny idea, something I would never actually do.” In her late twenties and after a series of unsatisfying office jobs, Melissa Plaut decided she was going to stop worrying about what to do with the rest of her life and focus on what she was going to do next. Her first adventure: becoming a taxi driver. Undeterred by the fact that 99 percent of cabbies in the city were men, she went to taxi school, got her hack license, and hit the streets of Manhattan and the outlying boroughs. Hack traces Plaut’s first two years behind the wheel of a yellow cab traveling the 6,400 miles of New York City streets. She shares the highs, the lows, the shortcuts, and professional trade secrets. Between figuring out where and when to take a bathroom break and trying to avoid run-ins with the NYPD, Plaut became an honorary member of a diverse brotherhood that included Harvey, the cross-dressing cabbie; the dispatcher affectionately called “Paul the crazy Romanian”; and Lenny, the garage owner rumored to be the real-life prototype for TV’s Louie De Palma of Taxi. With wicked wit and arresting insight, Melissa Plaut reveals the crazy parade of humanity that passed through her cab–including struggling actors, federal judges, bartenders, strippers, and drug dealers–while showing how this grueling work provided her with empowerment and a greater sense of self. Hack introduces an irresistible new voice that is much like New York itself–vivid, profane, lyrical, and ineffably hip From the Hardcover edition.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Vd_x3jKHj8gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Hack');

We hail them without thought after a wearying day at the office or an exuberant night on the town. And, undoubtedly, taxi drivers have stories to tell—of farcical local politics, of colorful passengers, of changing neighborhoods and clandestine shortcuts. No one knows a city’s streets—and thus its heart—better than its cabdrivers. And from behind the wheel of his taxi, Dmitry Samarov has seen more of Chicago than most Chicagoans will hope to experience in a lifetime. An artist and painter trained at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Samarov began driving a cab in 1993 to make ends meet, and he’s been working as a taxi driver ever since. In Hack: Stories from a Chicago Cab, he recounts tales that will delight, surprise, and sometimes shock the most seasoned urbanite. We follow Samarov through the rhythms of a typical week, as he waits hours at the garage to pick up a shift, ferries comically drunken passengers between bars, delivers prostitutes to their johns, and inadvertently observes drug deals. There are long waits with other cabbies at O’Hare, vivid portraits of street corners and their regular denizens, amorous Cubs fans celebrating after a game at Wrigley Field, and customers who are pleasantly surprised that Samarov is white—and tell him so. Throughout, Samarov’s own drawings—of his fares, of the taxi garage, and of a variety of Chicago street scenes—accompany his stories. In the grand tradition of Nelson Algren, Saul Bellow, Mike Royko, and Studs Terkel, Dmitry Samarov has rendered an entertaining, poignant, and unforgettable vision of Chicago and its people.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W10SwN7_HAkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Hack');

Positioned captures the best workforce planning practices from leading organizations such as Boeing, HP, the U.S. Intelligence Community, and others in the private and public sectors. The book’s Analytics section examines the evolution of workforce analytics and the roles of HR professionals and consultants. In an era of globally increasing complexity and competition for talent, shortages and misalignment can derail an organization’s effectiveness.

The authors do an outstanding job of presenting how organizations should address the challenges of virtual workforces so as to reap the huge potential benefits of increased growth, productivity, and innovation." -C. Warren Axelrod, PhD, Chief Privacy Officer and Business Information Security Officer, U.S. Trust, and author of Outsourcing Information Security "Lojeski and Reilly bring us something that readers of business books so rarely get-no nonsense practical guidance on how to manage distance, especially where it most often serves as an impediment to working effectively.? If you interface with widely dispersed team members who rarely see one another and communicate by virtue of impersonal electronics, you may expect to find this book provocative, counterintuitive, and above all, exciting. It gives all of us who have to struggle, while working with talent stretched across distance, hope, that maybe there are ways to do this right!" -Patrick J. McKenna, author of First Among Equals? "A must-read for global corporate executives who manage geographically dispersed job sharing teams. Practical strategies for preventing productivity loss and optimizing innovation. The authors pull no punches in showing the real downsides to the virtual work phenomenon; they have done a great service for us all." -Jeff Saperstein, author of Creating Regional Wealth in the Innovation Economy "Uniting the Virtual Workforce charts the course for competing in the twenty-first century by tapping into the powers of virtual work. Any manager who ignores the virtual workforce is underperforming, and any company or organization that does not appreciate virtual work is already at a competitive disadvantage. Karen and Dick have tapped into a key ingredient in the recipe for global growth." -Jerry MacArthur Hultin, President, Polytechnic University, and former Under Secretary of the Navy "Authors Sobel Lojeski and Reilly have provided a useful primer for the harried executive striving for productivity improvements while seeing the workload expand and the workforce disperse. Using conceptual definitions of Physical, Operational, and Affinity Distance to describe the multifaceted dimensions of building teams of people to work effectively together, the authors construct a very powerful set of metrics for a manager to improve the capability of his or her workgroup, no matter where it resides or how it is composed. The book is rich in anecdotes and specific studies that illustrate the concepts in an engaging, pertinent, and easy-to-understand manner. In an age of outsourcing, offshoring, and decentralizing groups of people who have to get things done together, reading this small book will repay itself many times over." -Charles House, Director, Media X Lab at Stanford University, and former Director of the Societal Impact of Technology, Intel Corporation', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iHby7ailOCEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Uniting the Virtual Workforce');

After a cataclysmic global run of thirty years, it has given birth to the age of the telecosm -- the world enabled and defined by new communications technology. Chips and software will continue to make great contributions to our lives, but the action is elsewhere. To seek the key to great wealth and to understand the bewildering ways that high tech is restructuring our lives, look not to chip speed but to communication power, or bandwidth. Bandwidth is exploding, and its abundance is the most important social and economic fact of our time. George Gilder is one of the great technological visionaries, and "the man who put the ''s'' in ''telecosm''" (Telephony magazine). He is equally famous for understanding and predicting the nuts and bolts of complex technologies, and for putting it all together in a soaring view of why things change, and what it means for our daily lives. His track record of futurist predictions is one of the best, often proving to be right even when initially opposed by mighty corporations and governments. He foresaw the power of fiber and wireless optics, the decline of the telephone regime, and the explosion of handheld computers, among many trends. His list of favored companies outpaced even the soaring Nasdaq in 1999 by more than double. His long-awaited Telecosm is a bible of the new age of communications. Equal parts science story, business history, social analysis, and prediction, it is the one book you need to make sense of the titanic changes underway in our lives. Whether you surf the net constantly or not at all, whether you live on your cell phone or hate it for its invasion of private life, you need this book. It has been less than two decades since the introduction of the IBM personal computer, and yet the enormous changes wrought in our lives by the computer will pale beside the changes of the telecosm. Gilder explains why computers will "empty out," with their components migrating to the net; why hundreds of low-flying satellites will enable hand-held computers and communicators to become ubiquitous; why television will die; why newspapers and magazines will revive; why advertising will become less obnoxious; and why companies will never be able to waste your time again. Along the way you will meet the movers and shakers who have made the telecosm possible. From Charles Townes and Gordon Gould, who invented the laser, to the story of JDS Uniphase, "the Intel of the Telecosm," to the birthing of fiberless optics pioneer TeraBeam, here are the inventors and entrepreneurs who will be hailed as the next Edison or Gates.

He navigates you faithfully through the digital world, encouraging frustrated parents not to throw out cell phones, ban the Internet, chuck computers, or pitch portable media devices. That would be a mistake and believe it or not would be going against more than seven decades of Catholic teaching. From Church documents on social communications, Gan extracts seven principles or "media keys" of how to approach and use media. The Church and Gan say that we must enter into the modern day "Areopagus," the social and intellectual hub of ancient Athens where Paul preached to pagans, and use the media tools God has given us to make truth known and serve mankind. Cardinal John Patrick Foley says, "Frankly, I wish that such a book had existed when I was president of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications as a text which I could have recommended. The important thing, however, is that it exists now to provide a text, context, and challenge for those who wish to bring both Christian principles and professional excellence to their work in the media." Gan offers chapter after chapter of real-life experience of how to assess movies, games, and gadgets for you and your teens. Of how to judge the merits of a film like Saving Private Ryan, and what sets it apart from Nightmare on Elm Street. Can the one be acceptable viewing and the other not? Definitely.

A triumphantly inspiring memoir, the first from a Kennedy family member since Rose Kennedy''s 1974 autobiography, Lawford''s Symptoms of Withdrawal tells the bittersweet truth about life inside America''s greatest family legacy. As the firstborn child of famed Rat Pack actor Peter Lawford and Patricia Kennedy, sister to John F. Kennedy, Christopher Kennedy Lawford grew up with presidents and movie stars as close relatives and personal friends. Lawford recalls Marilyn Monroe teaching him to dance the twist in his living room when he was still a toddler, being awakened late at night by his uncle Jack to hear him announce his candidacy for president, being perched atop a high-roller craps table in Las Vegas while Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack swapped jokes and threw dice, and other treasured memories of his youth as part of America''s royal family. In spite of this seemingly idyllic childhood, Lawford''s early life was marked by the traumatic assassinations of his beloved uncles Jack and Bobby, and he soon succumbed to the burgeoning drug scene of the 1970s during his teen years. With compelling realism mixed with equal doses of self-deprecating wit, youthful bravado, and hard-earned humility, Symptoms of Withdrawal chronicles Lawford''s deep and long descent into near-fatal drug and alcohol addiction, and his subsequent formidable path back to the sobriety he has preserved for the past twenty years. Symptoms of Withdrawal is a poignantly honest portrayal of Lawford''s life as a Kennedy, a journey overflowing with hilarious insider anecdotes, heartbreaking accounts of Lawford''s addictions to narcoticsas well as to celebrity and, ultimately, the redemption he found by asserting his own independence. In this groundbreakingly courageous and exceptionally well-written memoir, Lawford steps forward to rise above the buried pain that first led to his addiction, and today lives mindfully by his time-tested mantra: "We are only as sick as the secrets we keep." Symptoms of Withdrawal keeps no secrets and is a compelling testament to the power of truth.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J6MW4PAjVJgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Symptoms of Withdrawal');

But Diego Cordovez and Selig S. Harrison shatter this image. Out of Afghanistan shows that the Red Army was securely entrenched when the Soviet Union agreed to withdraw: American weaponry and Afghan bravery raised the costs for Moscow, but it was six years of skillful diplomacy that gave the Russians a way out. Cordovez and Harrison provide the definitive account of the Soviet blunders that led up to the invasion and the bitter struggles over the withdrawal that raged in the Soviet and Afghan Communist parties and the Reagan Administration. The authors are particularly well-suited to their task: Cordovez was the United Nations mediator who negotiated the Soviet pullout, and Harrison is a leading South Asia expert with four decades of experience in covering Afghanistan. Their story of the U.N. negotiations is interwoven with a gripping chronicle of the war years, complete with palace shootouts in Kabul, turf warfare between rival Soviet intelligence agencies, and the CIA role in building up Islamic fundamentalist guerrilla leaders at the expense of Afghan moderates. Cordovez opens up his diaries to take us behind the scenes in his negotiations, and Harrison draws on interviews with Mikhail Gorbachev, former Secretary of State George Shultz, and other key actors. The result is a book full of surprises. For example, the authors demonstrate that the Soviets intervened not out of a desire to drive to the Indian Ocean, but out of a fear of a U.S.-supported Afghan Tito. Rebuffs by hardline "bleeders" in the Reagan Administration undermined efforts by Yuri Andropov to secure a settlement before his death in 1983. Even more startling, Gorbachev resumed the search for a negotiated withdrawal more than a year before the first American-supplied Stinger missiles were deployed in the war. The Soviet intervention in Afghanistan was one of the pivotal events of recent history. Out of Afghanistan destroys many of the myths surrounding the Afghan war and will have a profound impact on the emerging debate over how and why the Cold War ended.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iFasqHGo3p0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Out of Afghanistan');

In Thoreau’s Democratic Withdrawal, Shannon L. Mariotti explores Thoreau’s nature writings to offer a new way of understanding the unique politics of the so-called hermit of Walden Pond. Drawing imaginatively from the twentieth-century German social theorist Theodor W. Adorno, she shows how withdrawal from the public sphere can paradoxically be a valuable part of democratic politics. Separated by time, space, and context, Thoreau and Adorno share a common belief that critical inquiry is essential to democracy but threatened by modern society. While walking, huckleberrying, and picking wild apples, Thoreau tries to recover the capacities for independent perception and thought that are blunted by “Main Street,” conventional society, and the rapidly industrializing world that surrounded him. Adorno’s thoughts on particularity and the microscopic gaze he employs to work against the alienated experience of modernity help us better understand the value of Thoreau’s excursions into nature. Reading Thoreau with Adorno, we see how periodic withdrawals from public spaces are not necessarily apolitical or apathetic but can revitalize our capacity for the critical thought that truly defines democracy. In graceful, readable prose, Mariotti reintroduces us to a celebrated American thinker, offers new insights on Adorno, and highlights the striking common ground they share. Their provocative and challenging ideas, she shows, still hold lessons on how we can be responsible citizens in a society that often discourages original, critical analysis of public issues.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NdLfcuEeA6MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Thoreau’s Democratic Withdrawal');

The awkward reality is that an Iraqi-U.S. failure to properly manage the U.S. withdrawal and the creation of effective Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) is as serious a threat to Iraq''s future stability and security as any internal or external threat. Realism is a key to future success. The improvement in ISF capabilities is very real, and Iraqi forces are experiencing growing success in combat. But they are still very much a work in progress, and many Iraqi and U.S. politicians still seem unaware of how much remains to be done. U.S. forces play a critical role in developing the effectiveness of the ISF, providing stability in areas with deep sectarian and ethnic tensions and helping Iraq achieve political accommodation and more effective governance.Through detailed analyses of Iraqi force capabilities, augmented by on-site interviews with U.S. and Iraqi military officials, the authors conclude that the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq needs to be “conditions-based,” not tied to political timelines. Both Iraqi and U.S. leaders need to be careful about exaggerating Iraqi capabilities and the speed with which the United States can safely withdraw its forces and advisory teams. Conditions for success include realistic and fully resourced plans for the ISF''s development; candid and accurate measures of ISF capabilities; and careful assessments of the overall level of security, stability, and political accommodation in Iraq.After years of destructive conflict, Iraq now has the chance, however tenuous, to become a stable and prosperous country.

It concludes with targeted recommendations for the multilateral development banks and U.S. agencies that work on infrastructure, with a focus on creating an expanded pipeline of projects that are bankable for the private sector.

Distributed databases and the infrastructure needed to support them have been well studied. However, this book is the first to address distributed database interoperability by examining the successes and failures, various approaches, infrastructures, and trends of the field. A gap exists in the way that these systems have been investigated by real practitioners. This gap is more pronounced than usual, partly because of the way businesses operate, the systems they have, and the difficulties created by systems'' autonomy and heterogeneity. Telecommunications firms, for example, must deal with an increased demand for automation while at the same time continuing to function at their current level. While academics are focusing on investigating differences between distributed databases, federated databases, heterogeneous databases, and, more generally, among loosely connected and tightly coupled systems, those who have to deal with real problems right away know that the only relevant research is the one that will ensure that their system works to produce reasonably correct results. Interconnecting Heterogeneous Information Systems covers the underlying principles and infrastructures needed to realize truly global information systems. The book discusses technologies related to middleware, the Web, workflows, transactions, and data warehousing. It also overviews architectures with a discussion of critical issues. The book gives an overview of systems that can be viewed as learning platforms. While these systems do not translate to successful commercial realities, they push the envelope in terms of research. Successful commercial systems have benefited from the experiments conducted in these prototypes. The book includes two case studies based on the authors'' own work.

Rather than focusing on the reality of who Christ is and what he has done for us, we allow ourselves to be identified by all the things we aren’t.

This thorough book provides a clear roadmap to designing, implementing and operating a help desk. The author leaves no key process out and completely covers everything from initial concept to measuring support effectiveness and process improvement. The book starts with an initial strategy that is focused on planning help desk services that are completely aligned to requirements and are based on a mission statement. This business-oriented approach is refreshing and will keep IT grounded in the real reasons for a help desk. More importantly is the process for careful selection of services to provide. An overly ambitious set of service goals will kill a help desk implementation early in its life by offering too much before there is a stable help desk process in place. This book is realistic and lays the foundation for a success implementation. The section on the actual design of the help desk structure provides insights and information that can be applied to a large number of solutions. Since help desks will be organized in accordance with requirements and unique mission statements, this section of the book is like a catalog of patterns. It has excellent tips on how to best structure the help desk to meet requirements and mission. The information on accurately estimating staffing requirements is consistent with industry best practices and something that, believe it or not, is often overlooked when help desks are established. This book gets into the meat by thoroughly covering the processes that are essential to running a help desk. There are many topics that stand out as both unique [to books of this genre] and reflectbest practices by the best-run help desks. Examples are change control, disaster recovery and vendor management. These topics show that the author not only considers business alignment, but also cross-functional alignment within IT. Professional resources and underlying technology are provided in detail. This book contains an in-depth coverage of operational requirements for the help desk once it has been implemented. It hits all of the critical success factors, such as performance metrics, service level agreements, communications and internal evaluations. It even has a chapter on marketing, which is something that is important but not often done be most help desks. This proactive approach to keeping users (your customers) informed of new services, accomplishments and tips is excellent and will go a long way towards attaining high customer satisfaction scores - not to mention proving the value of the help desk to IT and business management.

He was, as well, an intensely private man, and he authorized no biographies in his lifetime. Kate Buford is the first writer to win the cooperation of Lancaster''s widow, close friends, and colleagues, and her book is a revelation. Here is Lancaster the man, from his teenage years, bolting the Depression-era immigrant neighborhood of East Harlem where he grew up for the life of a circus acrobat -- then the electric New York theater of the 1930s, then the dying days of vaudeville. We see his production company -- Hecht-Hill-Lancaster -- become the biggest independent of the 1950s, a bridge between the studio era and modern filmmaking. With the power he derived from it we see him gain a remarkable degree of control, which he used to become the auteur of his own career. His navigation through the anti-Communist witch-hunts made him an example of a star who tweaked the noses of HUAC and survived. His greatest roles -- in Sweet Smell of Success, Elmer Gantry, Birdman of Alcatraz, The Swimmer, Atlantic City -- kept to the progressive edge that had originated in the tolerant, diverse, reforming principles of his childhood. And in the extraordinary complete roster of his films -- From Here to Eternity, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Judgment at Nuremberg, The Leopard, 1900, and Field of Dreams, among many others -- he proved to be both a master of commercial movies that pleased a worldwide audience and an actor who pushed himself beyond stardom into cinematic art.

Written by an in-the-trenches professional who works with HD every day, High Definition Postproduction is an overview of this exciting opportunity for film and video production and postproduction professionals. High Definition production and editing is here and definitely a reality. High-def network shows are aired on a weekly basis. Several HD-only channels are well into their production schedules. HD is even used for major film productions and post production processes. However, unlike the existing 4x3, NTSC format, the HD world has many variables. This ability to choose various frame rates, frame sizes, bit rates, and color space options makes this an exciting, yet somewhat daunting challenge. The future may hold even more options as electronics continue to evolve and manufactures continue to exploit this format. Naturally, all of these options can lead to confusion and errors. This book begins with an overview of the HD format and then covers commonly-asked questions. A chapter on shooting details how to smooth the path for post. Postproduction workflows, including the digital intermediate, are covered in great detail, and are enhanced by real-world examples.

Stephen Davies describes and analyzes the definition of art as it has been discussed in Anglo-American philosophy during this period and, in the process, introduces his own perspective on ways in which we should reorient our thinking.Davies conceives of the debate as revealing two basic, conflicting approaches—the functional and the procedural—to the questions of whether art can be defined, and if so, how. As the author sees it, the functionalist believes that an object is a work of art only if it performs a particular function (usually, that of providing a rewarding aesthetic experience). By contrast the proceduralist believes that something is an artwork only if it has been created according to certain rules and procedures. Davies attempts to demonstrate the fruitfulness of viewing the debate in terms of this framework, and he develops new arguments against both points of view—although he is more critical of functional than of procedural definitions.Because it has generated so much of the recent literature, Davies starts his analysis with a discussion of Morris Weitz''s germinal paper, "The Role of Theory in Aesthetics." He goes on to examine other important works by Arthur Danto, George Dickie, and Ben Tilghman and develops in his critiques original arguments on such matters of the artificiality of artworks and the relevance of artists'' intentions.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6peJnXr4L5gC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Definitions of Art');

How will our carefree idealist, who is content with so little and has no chance of paying it back, find a way out of this mess?

In SAP you can verify invoices against purchase orders and goods receipts. SAP provides important functionalities like automatic account determination, financial posting, etc. SAP is powerful software that can meet the needs of any business scenario for any type of business in any part of the world. Its all encompassing nature makes SAP complex. In order to derive maximum benefit for business, SAP must be understood well. Mr. Agrawal attempts to explain SAP completely; a seemingly impossible task. This is his third book on the Materials Management module; his first two books in the Materials Management module are ‘Purchasing’ and ‘Inventory Management’. In this book, like in his earlier books, he explains every screen of SAP MM Invoice Verification. Both the SAP Menu and Customizing Implementation Guide are expanded and the chapter number where they are covered is indicated. This not only creates a direct link between the book and the SAP software, but also ensures that the book is comprehensive. The author has taken care to balance details with overviews that explain linkages between concepts. The book is organized in chapters that are important business activities. Each chapter covers business processes carried out in SAP by the user as well as its related configuration. This book can be used to learn SAP from scratch; it is a learning guide. It is, therefore, useful to persons who are training to be SAP Consultants. Having learnt SAP with the help of this book, the Consultant keeps returning to refer to it. In implementation of SAP, Consultants prepare User Manual. With the availability of this book, their task becomes simpler. In the User Manual, they need to cover only implementation specific points. The user refers to this book as a generic User Manual. As the user gains knowledge he also begins to understand the customizing settings for his implementation. This book can also be used by Business Process Owners and Senior Managers to get an overview of SAP and the important choices it offers.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bYIlBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'SAP MM INVOICE VERIFICATION');

Adding to the confusion is the fact that it falls between two teams the MM team and the FI team and each assumes that the other is responsible for the design and configuration of Invoice Verification. Although the process can be streamlined, many organizations get the design and use of invoice verification wrong, resulting in vendors not being paid and accounts being placed on stop, which prevents further Purchase Orders from being processed until the vendor has been paid. The aim of this book is to help readers fully understand the invoice verification process, particularly the changes in ERP 6.0. If they get the design right, then the process will run smoothly and vendors will be paid on time (not too early either). User input can be kept to a minimum and much of the process can be automatic. There are one or two basic mistakes that are made during the design of the process and the guide highlights these (and many other confusing areas), and describes, in simple terms, the options available along with the consequences of getting it wrong. Stephen Birchall has more than 34 years of IT consulting experience and has spent the last 24 years as a SAP consultant. Stephen has expansive knowledge of SAP systems and modules, his primary area of expertise is SAP MM and AP processes. Stephen worked as a Lead Logistics Trainer at the SAP UK training center for 4 years, delivering a wide spectrum of SAP logistics courses including Invoice Verification / AP courses. In each of those 4 years 1995/6/7 and 8 SAP identified Stephen as the highest rated SAP trainer in the UK. While at the training center in the UK, Stephen single-handedly delivered the 5 week MM Academy ten times, back-to-back and loved every minute of it! Mr. Birchall was asked by SAP AG to write some additional exam questions for SAP''s MM exam. Stephen''s enthusiasm for SAP software is based on his first-hand experience of its capabilities on various projects at several major organizations, including several assignments for Deloitte, Accenture, SAP and HCL Axon. As a consultant, Stephen has experience in a wide variety of industries, ranging from the music industry to pharmaceutical organizations', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DTJZBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Invoice Verification for SAP');

Finally, in order to place the subject in the appropriate historical and conceptual context we trace the main roots of Kolmogorov complexity. This way the stage is set for Chapters 2 and 3, where we introduce the notion of optimal effective descriptions of objects. The length of such a description (or the number of bits of information in it) is its Kolmogorov complexity. We treat all aspects of the elementary mathematical theory of Kolmogorov complexity. This body of knowledge may be called algo rithmic complexity theory. The theory of Martin-Lof tests for random ness of finite objects and infinite sequences is inextricably intertwined with the theory of Kolmogorov complexity and is completely treated. We also investigate the statistical properties of finite strings with high Kolmogorov complexity. Both of these topics are eminently useful in the applications part of the book. We also investigate the recursion theoretic properties of Kolmogorov complexity (relations with Godel''s incompleteness result), and the Kolmogorov complexity version of infor mation theory, which we may call "algorithmic information theory" or "absolute information theory.

In doing so, he brought together psychoanalytic and social theory, and examined how divisions of race, class and culture reflect and influence splits in the developing self, more often than not leading to a negative self image of the "other" in an increasingly polarized society. Much like the original, this second edition of The Analyst in the Inner City opens up with updated, detailed clinical vignettes and case presentations, which illustrate the challenges of working within this clinical milieu. Altman greatly expands his section on race, both in the psychoanalytic and the larger social world, including a focus on "whiteness" which, he argues, is socially constructed in relation to "blackness." However, he admits the inadequacy of such categorizations and proffers a more fluid view of the structure of race. A brand new section, "Thinking Systemically and Psychoanalytically at the Same Time," examines the impact of the socio-political context in which psychotherapy takes place, whether local or global, on the clinical work itself and the socio-economic categories of its patients, and vice-versa. Topics in this section include the APA''s relationship to CIA interrogation practices, group dynamics in child and adolescent psychotherapeutic interventions, and psychoanalytic views on suicide bombing. Ranging from the day-to-day work in a public clinic in the South Bronx to considerations of global events far outside the clinic''s doors (but closer than one might think), this book is a timely revision of a groundbreaking work in psychoanalytic literature, expanding the import of psychoanalysis from the centers of analytical thought to the margins of clinical need.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UbnrzrdqkTAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Analyst in the Inner City');

Although the tools are far more interesting and useful than the rules, they tend to be neglected in favor of other aspects of the curriculum. In The Legal Analyst, Ward Farnsworth brings together in one place all of the most powerful of those tools for thinking about law. From classic ideas in game theory such as the “Prisoner’s Dilemma” and the “Stag Hunt” to psychological principles such as hindsight bias and framing effects, from ideas in jurisprudence such as the slippery slope to more than two dozen other such principles, Farnsworth’s guide leads readers through the fascinating world of legal thought. Each chapter introduces a single tool and shows how it can be used to solve different types of problems. The explanations are written in clear, lively language and illustrated with a wide range of examples.

One Sunday afternoon, as she unloaded the dishwasher, Gretchen Rubin felt hit by a wave of homesickness. Homesick—why? She was standing right in her own kitchen. She felt homesick, she realized, with love for home itself. “Of all the elements of a happy life,” she thought, “my home is the most important.” In a flash, she decided to undertake a new happiness project, and this time, to focus on home. And what did she want from her home? A place that calmed her, and energized her. A place that, by making her feel safe, would free her to take risks. Also, while Rubin wanted to be happier at home, she wanted to appreciate how much happiness was there already. So, starting in September (the new January), Rubin dedicated a school year—September through May—to making her home a place of greater simplicity, comfort, and love. In The Happiness Project, she worked out general theories of happiness. Here she goes deeper on factors that matter for home, such as possessions, marriage, time, and parenthood. How can she control the cubicle in her pocket? How might she spotlight her family’s treasured possessions? And it really was time to replace that dud toaster. Each month, Rubin tackles a different theme as she experiments with concrete, manageable resolutions—and this time, she coaxes her family to try some resolutions, as well.

Distributed databases and the infrastructure needed to support them have been well studied. However, this book is the first to address distributed database interoperability by examining the successes and failures, various approaches, infrastructures, and trends of the field. A gap exists in the way that these systems have been investigated by real practitioners. This gap is more pronounced than usual, partly because of the way businesses operate, the systems they have, and the difficulties created by systems'' autonomy and heterogeneity. Telecommunications firms, for example, must deal with an increased demand for automation while at the same time continuing to function at their current level. While academics are focusing on investigating differences between distributed databases, federated databases, heterogeneous databases, and, more generally, among loosely connected and tightly coupled systems, those who have to deal with real problems right away know that the only relevant research is the one that will ensure that their system works to produce reasonably correct results. Interconnecting Heterogeneous Information Systems covers the underlying principles and infrastructures needed to realize truly global information systems. The book discusses technologies related to middleware, the Web, workflows, transactions, and data warehousing. It also overviews architectures with a discussion of critical issues. The book gives an overview of systems that can be viewed as learning platforms. While these systems do not translate to successful commercial realities, they push the envelope in terms of research. Successful commercial systems have benefited from the experiments conducted in these prototypes. The book includes two case studies based on the authors'' own work. Interconnecting Heterogeneous Information Systems is suitable as a textbook for a graduate-level course on Interconnecting Heterogeneous Information Systems, as well as a secondary text for a graduate-level course on database or information systems, and as a reference for researchers and practitioners in industry.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1wrrBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Interconnecting Heterogeneous Information Systems');

So how do you ensure a steady flow of repeat business? The secret—no matter what industry you’re in—is finding and keeping automatic customers. These days virtually anything you need can be purchased through a subscription, with more convenience than ever before. Far beyond Spotify, Netflix, and New York Times subscriptions, you can sign up for weekly or monthly supplies of everything from groceries (AmazonFresh) to cosmetics (Birchbox) to razor blades (Dollar Shave Club). According to John Warrillow, this emerging subscription economy offers huge opportunities to companies that know how to turn customers into subscribers. Automatic customers are the key to increasing cash flow, igniting growth, and boosting the value of your company. Consider Whatsapp, the internet-based messaging service that was purchased by Facebook for $19 billion. While other services bombarded users with invasive ads in order to fund a free messaging platform, Whatsapp offered a refreshingly private tool on a subscription platform, charging just $1 per year. Their business model enabled the kind of service that customers wanted and ensured automatic customers for years to come. As Warrillow shows, subscriptions aren’t limited to technology or media businesses. Companies in nearly any industry, from start-ups to the Fortune 500, from home contractors to florists, can build subscriptions into their business. Warrillow provides the essential blueprint for winning automatic customers with one of the nine subscription business models, including: The Membership Website Model: Companies like The Wood Whisperer Guild, ContractorSelling.com, and DanceStudioOwner.com offer access to highly specialized, high quality information, recognizing that people will pay for good content. This model can work for any business with a tightly defined niche market and insider information. The Simplifier Model: Companies like Mosquito Squad (pest control) and Hassle Free Homes (home maintenance) take a recurring task off your to-do list. Any business serving busy consumers can adopt this model not only to create a recurring revenue stream, but also to take advantage of the opportunity to cross-sell or bundle their services. The Surprise Box Model: Companies like BarkBox (dog treats) and Standard Cocoa (craft chocolate) send their subscribers curated packages of goodies each month. If you can handle the logistics of shipping, giving customers joy in something new can translate to sales on your larger e-commerce site. This book also shows you how to master the psychology of selling subscriptions and how to reduce churn and provides a road map for the essential statistics you need to measure the health of your subscription business. Whether you want to transform your entire business into a recurring revenue engine or just pick up an extra 5 percent of sales growth, The Automatic Customer will be your secret weapon.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Xs46BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Automatic Customer');

Now their latest research reveals something even more surprising: Being a Challenger seller isn''t enough. Your success or failure also depends on who you challenge. Picture your ideal customer: friendly, eager to meet, ready to coach you through the sale and champion your products and services across the organization. It turns out that''s the last person you need. Most marketing and sales teams go after low-hanging fruit: buyers who are eager and have clearly articulated needs. That''s simply human nature; it''s much easier to build a relationship with someone who always makes time for you, engages with your content, and listens attentively. But according to brand-new CEB research--based on data from thousands of B2B marketers, sellers, and buyers around the world--the highest-performing teams focus their time on potential customers who are far more skeptical, far less interested in meeting, and ultimately agnostic as to who wins the deal. How could this be? The authors of The Challenger Customer reveal that high-performing B2B teams grasp something that their average-performing peers don''t: Now that big, complex deals increasingly require consensus among a wide range of players across the organization, the limiting factor is rarely the salesperson''s inability to get an individual stakeholder to agree to a solution. More often it''s that the stakeholders inside the company can''t even agree with one another about what the problem is. It turns out only a very specific type of customer stakeholder has the credibility, persuasive skill, and will to effectively challenge his or her colleagues to pursue anything more ambitious than the status quo. These customers get deals to the finish line far more often than friendlier stakeholders who seem so receptive at first. In other words, Challenger sellers do best when they target Challenger customers. The Challenger Customer unveils research-based tools that will help you distinguish the "Talkers" from the "Mobilizers" in any organization. It also provides a blueprint for finding them, engaging them with disruptive insight, and equipping them to effectively challenge their own organization.

But a century into our love affair with plastic, we’re starting to realize it’s not such a healthy relationship. Plastics draw on dwindling fossil fuels, leach harmful chemicals, litter landscapes, and destroy marine life. As journalist Susan Freinkel points out in this engaging and eye-opening book, we’re nearing a crisis point. We’ve produced as much plastic in the past decade as we did in the entire twentieth century. We’re drowning in the stuff, and we need to start making some hard choices. Freinkel gives us the tools we need with a blend of lively anecdotes and analysis. She combs through scientific studies and economic data, reporting from China and across the United States to assess the real impact of plastic on our lives. She tells her story through eight familiar plastic objects: comb, chair, Frisbee, IV bag, disposable lighter, grocery bag, soda bottle, and credit card. Her conclusion: we cannot stay on our plastic-paved path. And we don’t have to. Plastic points the way toward a new creative partnership with the material we love to hate but can’t seem to live without.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9LyGHqqIKT4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Plastic');

In her quirky and humorous style—well known to the readers of her popular blog, My Plastic-Free Life—Terry provides personal anecdotes, stats about the environmental and health problems related to plastic, and personal solutions and tips on how to limit your plastic footprint. Terry includes handy lists and charts for easy reference, ways to get involved in larger community actions, and profiles of individuals— Plastic-Free Heroes—who have gone beyond personal solutions to create a change on a larger scale. Plastic-Free also includes chapters on letting go of eco-guilt, strategies for coping with overwhelming problems, and ways to relate to other people who aren’t as far along on the plastic-free path.

This factor is the key performance indicator (KPI) for any business. The goal of improved ROI becomes all the more difficult when comparing the effectiveness of competing marketing strategies because intangible factors in the purchasing decision such as brand awareness as well as product credibility and loyalty cannot be easily quantified. Even the consumer often has an unconscious preference for one particular product over another. In this regard online marketing offers the advantage of the pull-principle: the user, who pulls the information that he/she is seeking for directly from the Internet, initiates all activities. This implies that a relationship is established between the corporation and consumer. With 90 percent of all Internet users choosing to access a SE during a given session, this first point of contact becomes often decisive in the success or failure for the online marketing concept. Nevertheless, there is an inter-dependency between both the attractiveness and the ability to locate a website, i.e. its findability . A website s content may be highly interesting and appropriate to the user s needs but it will be condemned to failure if it cannot be correctly sourced (i.e. ranked) by a SE. Be that as it may, every top ranked website will be rejected if content and usability disappoint expectations. This report intends to show how Search Engine Optimization (SEO) can be used in a strategic context as the first part of the lead process. SEO highlights the importance of keyword decisions in order to attract customers who secure high conversion rates and thus increase sales, be it online or offline. The first part of this analysis will explain the technical background of how SEs and keywords work. Also, there are several influential factors that should be considered when optimizing keywords for one s business, such as SE algorithms, the SE market, the consumer and his position in the buying cycle as well as online competitors.

Jon Lomow, strategic planner from Venture Communications, developed a method called SE Scorecard , which methodically analyzes the site s key figures. According to him, a website s keyword phrases, competitors, relevant SEs and SERP determines a marketer s overall SE share, relative to his direct competitors. First of all, these have to be identified. First step of his analysis is a scorecard that registers the performance of one s own and competing companies keyword SERP. Within the second step these results are then merged in an overview of competitive scores sorted by keyword. This overview can help identify whether or not a keyword is worth spending resources on and which keywords are not specifically targeted by competitors. Since the placement in the organic search will vary over time the third scorecard shows the ranking performance per company per e.g. month and is compiled up in an overview detailing ranking performance per company over time and over selected SEs. These figures act as an indicator for all keyword measurements for these SEs and serve as trend data for possible intervention. These scorecards can only give a first impression of competitor activities. The Keyword Effectiveness Competitive Analysis gives a more detailed picture of the overall keyword competition and an indication of their first keywords.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=usVxAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Application of Search Engine Marketing Methods in order to generate High-Quality Traffic');

NATIONAL BESTSELLER Welcome to Oldham, CT, a small town rich in Colonial heritage while being utterly contemporary. Situated along the Connecticut River Valley, Oldham bursts with color every fall, as the leaves on its trees evolve into an unmatched palette of scarlet, orange, purple, yellow, and bronze. For more than three decades, the Gold family has been a central part of Oldham in the fall, its Sugar Maple Inn a destination for “leaf-peepers” from all over the country, and its annual Halloween party a stirring way to punctuate the town’s most active month. But this year, more than just the leaves are changing. With the death of their parents, the Gold siblings, Maria, Maxwell, Deborah, Corrina, and Tyler, have decided to sell the Sugar Maple Inn, and this year’s Halloween party will be the last. As October begins, the Golds contend with the finality that faces them, and the implications it has for a family that has always been so close. For some, it means embracing new challenges and new love. For others, it means taking on unimagined roles. And for others, it means considering the inconceivable. Complicating it all is a series of “hauntings” that touch each of the Gold siblings, a series of benign interventions that will remain a mystery until October draws to a close. Filled with romance, tension, and unforgettable family drama, LEAVES is the first in a series of novels about a world and a family that readers will want to make their own. “The characters are so life-like that they become one’s own family....

Keith Negus examines the contrasting strategies of major labels like Sony and Polygram in managing different genres, artists and staff. How do takeovers affect the treatment of artists? Why has Polygram been perceived as too European to attract US artists? And how did Warner''s wooden floors help them sign Green Day? Through in-depth case studies of three major genres; rap, country, and salsa, Negus explores the way in which the music industry recognises and rewards certain sounds, and how this influences both the creativity of musicians, and their audiences. He examines the tension between raps public image as the spontaneous `music of the streets'' and the practicalities of the market, and asks why country labels and radio stations promote top-selling acts like Garth Brooks over hard-to-classify artists like Mary Chapin-Carpenter, and how the lack of soundscan systems in Puerto Rican record shops affects salsa music''s position on the US Billboard chart. Drawing on over seventy interviews with music industry personnel in Britain and the United States, Music Genres and Corporate Cultures shows how the creation, circulation and consumption of popular music is shaped by record companies and corporate business styles while stressing that music production takes within a broader culture, not totally within the control of large corporations.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Y1OoJE0cu-EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Music Genres and Corporate Cultures');

Singer asks "What about the business executives?" Breaking out of the guns-for-hire mold of traditional mercenaries, corporations now sell skills and services that until recently only state militaries possessed. Their products range from trained commando teams to strategic advice from generals. This new "Privatized Military Industry" encompasses hundreds of companies, thousands of employees, and billions of dollars in revenue. Whether as proxies or suppliers, such firms have participated in wars in Africa, Asia, the Balkans, and Latin America. More recently, they have become a key element in U.S. military operations. Private corporations working for profit now sway the course of national and international conflict, but the consequences have been little explored. In Corporate Warriors, Singer provides the first account of the military services industry and its broader implications. Corporate Warriors includes a description of how the business works, as well as portraits of each of the basic types of companies: military providers that offer troops for tactical operations; military consultants that supply expert advice and training; and military support companies that sell logistics, intelligence, and engineering. This updated edition of Singer''s already classic account of the military services industry and its broader implications describes the continuing importance of that industry in the Iraq War. This conflict has amply borne out Singer''s argument that the privatization of warfare allows startling new capabilities and efficiencies in the ways that war is carried out. At the same time, however, Singer finds that the introduction of the profit motive onto the battlefield raises troubling questions—for democracy, for ethics, for management, for human rights, and for national security.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_9sXXff8KLQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Corporate Warriors');

Dr. Richard Jackson looks at the root causes of our malaise and highlights healthy community designs achieved by planners, designers, and community leaders working together. Ultimately, Dr. Jackson encourages all of us to make the kinds of positive changes highlighted in this book. 2012 Nautilus Silver Award Winning Title in category of ?Social Change? In this book, Dr. Jackson explores how the built environment has contributed to the fact that two-thirds of Americans are overweight, 70 million are obese and many suffer from an array of other chronic but preventable diseases. The book and series looks upstream at the root causes of our malaise, and highlights actionable best practices based on real people with real solutions. Public health has traditionally associated the built environment with issues such as poor sanitation, lead paint poisoning and children, workplace safety, fire codes and access for persons with disabilities. We now realize that how we design the built environment may hold tremendous potential for addressing---and hopefully preventing---many of the nation?s current public health concerns. The Designing Healthy Communities book offers a new perspective on the topics covered in each episode while providing a roadmap and tools for readers to effect similar positive change in their own communities.Dr. Jackson is a vibrant public speaker, highly skilled at distilling ideas to a simple and understandable conversation. Unlike textbooks on the topic, this book seeks to feel more like a conversation between Dr. Jackson and the many people he has met along the road. Through stories and examples, he will encourage readers to consider their own experience and why taking initiative to make positive change in society is important. Part 1 ? Living and Leading With Purpose: Introduces the major themes that guide Dick Jackson?s life and work. This section sets the stage and provides a context for understanding specific actions. In each thematic area, we move from the specific (ourselves and those close to us) to the broader view. Chapter 1: What Does Caritas Have to Do With the Built Environment? Chapter 2: What is Health and How Do We Measure It? Chapter 3: Can Built Environment Build Community Part 2 ? A Legacy in Concrete: Each chapter details a place where Dick Jackson?s ideas have been manifested. Each chapter reviews the community in the style of a medical case study: symptoms, diagnosis, cure, and prevention. This is the nuts-and-bolts of Dr. Jackson?s view of public health is manifested in specific locations. Chapter 4: From Monoculture to Human Culture - curing social and environmental malnutrition: Belmar, Colorado Chapter 5: Using the Principles of New Urbanism to Build Community Prairie Crossing, Illinois Chapter 6: Saving America?s downtown and local history through the political process: Charleston, South Carolina Chapter 7: Reinventing a City through Community Leadership for Sustainability: a vital part of sustainability is being healthy: Elgin, Illinois Chapter 8: Ending Car Captivity ? Leadership Paths to Culture: Boulder, Colorado Chapter 9: Ports Are Rest Stops Along the Global Highway: Oakland, California Chapter 10: The city that won''t give up - entrepreneurship and urban agriculture: Detroit, Michigan Part 3 - Be The Change You Want to See in the World: This section makes the case that the reader can use Dick Jackson?s vision and tools to effect similar improvements in their own communities. Chapters examine how to effect change through the power of one person leading groups with purpose and working effectively to engage others. We introduce the different stakeholders in a community (government agencies, NGOs, parents, children, businesses, professionals, etc.) and discuss how they work together to achieve results.

Leading companies have discovered that technology is not enough, and that cultivating communities of practice is the keystone of an effective knowledge strategy. Communities of practice come together around common interests and expertise- whether they consist of first-line managers or customer service representatives, neurosurgeons or software programmers, city managers or home-improvement amateurs. They create, share, and apply knowledge within and across the boundaries of teams, business units, and even entire companies-providing a concrete path toward creating a true knowledge organization. InCultivating Communities of Practice, Etienne Wenger, Richard McDermott, and William M. Snyder argue that while communities form naturally, organizations need to become more proactive and systematic about developing and integrating them into their strategy. This book provides practical models and methods for stewarding these communities to reach their full potential-without squelching the inner drive that makes them so valuable. Through in-depth cases from firms such as DaimlerChrysler, McKinsey & Company, Shell, and the World Bank, the authors demonstrate how communities of practice can be leveraged to drive overall company strategy, generate new business opportunities, tie personal development to corporate goals, transfer best practices, and recruit and retain top talent. They define the unique features of these communities and outline principles for nurturing their essential elements. They provide guidelines to support communities of practice through their major stages of development, address the potential downsides of communities, and discuss the specific challenges of distributed communities. And they show how to recognize the value created by communities of practice and how to build a corporate knowledge strategy around them. Essential reading for any leader in today''s knowledge economy, this is the definitive guide to developing communities of practice for the benefit-and long-term success-of organizations and the individuals who work in them.

Crime goes down. The prison population doubles. Fraud by the rich wipes out 40 percent of the world’s wealth. The rich get massively richer. No one goes to jail. In search of a solution, journalist Matt Taibbi discovered the Divide, the seam in American life where our two most troubling trends—growing wealth inequality and mass incarceration—come together, driven by a dramatic shift in American citizenship: Our basic rights are now determined by our wealth or poverty. The Divide is what allows massively destructive fraud by the hyperwealthy to go unpunished, while turning poverty itself into a crime—but it’s impossible to see until you look at these two alarming trends side by side. In The Divide, Matt Taibbi takes readers on a galvanizing journey through both sides of our new system of justice—the fun-house-mirror worlds of the untouchably wealthy and the criminalized poor. He uncovers the startling looting that preceded the financial collapse; a wild conspiracy of billionaire hedge fund managers to destroy a company through dirty tricks; and the story of a whistleblower who gets in the way of the largest banks in America, only to find herself in the crosshairs. On the other side of the Divide, Taibbi takes us to the front lines of the immigrant dragnet; into the newly punitive welfare system which treats its beneficiaries as thieves; and deep inside the stop-and-frisk world, where standing in front of your own home has become an arrestable offense. As he narrates these incredible stories, he draws out and analyzes their common source: a perverse new standard of justice, based on a radical, disturbing new vision of civil rights. Through astonishing—and enraging—accounts of the high-stakes capers of the wealthy and nightmare stories of regular people caught in the Divide’s punishing logic, Taibbi lays bare one of the greatest challenges we face in contemporary American life: surviving a system that devours the lives of the poor, turns a blind eye to the destructive crimes of the wealthy, and implicates us all. Praise for The Divide “Ambitious . . . deeply reported, highly compelling . . . impossible to put down.”—The New York Times Book Review “These are the stories that will keep you up at night. . . . The Divide is not just a report from the new America; it is advocacy journalism at its finest.”—Los Angeles Times “Taibbi is a relentless investigative reporter. He takes readers inside not only investment banks, hedge funds and the blood sport of short-sellers, but into the lives of the needy, minorities, street drifters and illegal immigrants. . . . The Divide is an important book. Its documentation is powerful and shocking.”—The Washington Post “Captivating . . . The Divide enshrines its author’s position as one of the most important voices in contemporary American journalism.”—The Independent (UK) “Taibbi [is] perhaps the greatest reporter on Wall Street’s crimes in the modern era.”—Salon From the Hardcover edition.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VcwKAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Divide');

Held in Dresden, this conference brought together almost 400 analytic psychotherapists from Europe, all of them engaged within the EFPP, through their various national societies, in the different applications of psychoanalytic methods in the public healthcare sector - either in healthcare systems subject to public law or in those run by the state for in-patient and out-patient treatment and during rehabilitation. The theme of the conference "Crossing Borders - Integrating Differences" required the speakers, as psychoanalytic psychotherapists, to give thought to their daily task of crossing borders and integrating differences. This book with all its papers will stimulate the readers to cross borders: between theory and practice, between research and everyday therapy, between out-patient and in-patient psychotherapy, between the view of one''s own, the known and the culturally foreign. Yet it is only with an awareness of these borders, an acknowledgement and respect for them, that it will be possible to proceed towards integrating differences, where this makes sense and appears necessary.

He explores recent world events, discussing how current issues such as migration, terrorism, global warming, pandemics, the international human rights regime, outsourcing, the economic crisis, supranational integration, regionalization, and digital technology relate to borders and influence our lives.

While Partition sounds smooth on paper, the reality was horrific. More than eight million people migrated and one million died in the process. The forced migration, violence between Hindus and Muslims, and mass widowhood were unprecedented and well-documented. What was less obvious but equally real was that millions of people had to realign their identities, uncertain about who they thought they were. The rending of the social and emotional fabric that took place in 1947 is still far from mended. While there are plenty of official accounts of Partition, there are few social histories and no feminist histories. Borders and Boundaries changes that, providing first-hand accounts and memoirs, juxtaposed alongside official government accounts. The authors make women not only visible but central. They explore what country, nation, and religious identity meant for women, and they address the question of the nation-state and the gendering of citizenship. In the largest ever peace-time mass migration of people, violence against women became the norm. Thousands of women committed suicide or were done to death by their own kinsmen. Nearly 100,000 women were "abducted" during the migration. A young woman might have been separated from her family when a convoy was ambushed, abducted by people of another religion, forced to convert, and forced into marriage or cohabitation. After bearing a child, she would be offered the opportunity to return only if she left her child behind and if she could face shame in her natal community. These stories do not paint their subjects as victims. Theirs are the stories of battles over gender, the body, sexuality, and nationalism-stories of women fighting for identity.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yNN4SE7cL60C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Borders & Boundaries');

Poor and despised by the society around her, she’s also badly treated by her family. Raped and abused by her father, she strives to protect her sister, Nettie, from a similar fate. Nettie escapes to a new life as a missionary in Africa, and their father sells Celie as a child bride to an older suitor. Now without her best friend and confidant, she is sentenced to a life alone with a harsh and abusive husband. Celie begins writing letters directly to God in an attempt to transcend a life that often seems too much to bear. Her letters span twenty years and record a journey of self-discovery and empowerment guided by the light of a few strong women. She meets Shug Avery, her husband’s mistress and a jazz singer with a zest for life, and Sophia, her stepson’s wife, who challenges her to fight for independence. And though her husband hides the many letters from her sister, Nettie’s unwavering support will prove to be the most breathtaking of all.

Yet the role radical feminism played within the women''s movement remains hotly contested. For some, radical feminism has made a lasting contribution to our understanding of male privilege, and the ways the power imbalance between men and women affects the everyday fabric of women''s lives. For others, radical feminism represents a reflexive hostility toward men, sex, and heterosexuality, and thus is best ignored or forgotten. Rather than have the movement be interpreted by others, Radical Feminism permits the original work of radical feminists to speak for itself. Comprised of pivotal documents written by U.S. radical feminists in the 1960s and 1970s, Radical Feminism combines both unpublished and previously published manifestos, position papers, minutes of meetings, and newsletters essential to an understanding of radical feminism. Consisting of documents unavailable to the general public, and others in danger of being lost altogether, this panoramic collection is organized around the key issues of sex and sexuality, race, children, lesbianism, separatism, and class. Barbara A. Crow rescues the groundbreaking original work of such groups as The Furies, Redstockings, Cell 16, and the Women''s Liberation Movement. Contributors include Kate Millet, Susan Brownmiller, Shulamith Firestone, Rosalyn Baxandall, Toni Morrison, Ellen Willis, Anne Koett, and Vivan Gornick. Gathered for the first time in one volume, these primary sources of radical feminism fill a major gap in the literature on feminism and feminist thought.

It begins with an introduction to the basic concepts of sliding modes to provide a background to the field. This is followed by chapters that describe the use and design of sliding-mode observers for FDI using robust fault reconstruction. The development of a class of sliding-mode observers is described from first principles through to the latest schemes that circumvent minimum-phase and relative-degree conditions. Recent developments have shown that the field of fault tolerant control is a natural application of the well-known robustness properties of sliding-mode control. A family of sliding-mode control designs incorporating control allocation, which can deal with actuator failures directly by exploiting redundancy, is presented. Various realistic case studies, specifically highlighting aircraft systems and including results from the implementation of these designs on a motion flight simulator, are described. A reference and guide for researchers in fault detection and fault-tolerant control, this book will also be of interest to graduate students working with nonlinear systems and with sliding modes in particular. Advances in Industrial Control aims to report and encourage the transfer of technology in control engineering. The rapid development of control technology has an impact on all areas of the control discipline.

However, the discovery of quantum error correction and the proof of the accuracy threshold theorem nearly ten years ago gave rise to extensive development and research aimed at creating a working, scalable quantum computer. Over a decade has passed since this monumental accomplishment yet no book-length pedagogical presentation of this important theory exists. Quantum Error Correction and Fault Tolerant Quantum Computing offers the first full-length exposition on the realization of a theory once thought impossible. It provides in-depth coverage on the most important class of codes discovered to date—quantum stabilizer codes. It brings together the central themes of quantum error correction and fault-tolerant procedures to prove the accuracy threshold theorem for a particular noise error model. The author also includes a derivation of well-known bounds on the parameters of quantum error correcting code. Packed with over 40 real-world problems, 35 field exercises, and 17 worked-out examples, this book is the essential resource for any researcher interested in entering the quantum field as well as for those who want to understand how the unexpected realization of quantum computing is possible.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zwvlqspyOK8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Quantum Error Correction and Fault Tolerant Quantum Computing');

In such cases, designers devise mechanisms and architectures that allow the system to either completely mask the effects of a component failure or recover from it so quickly that the application is not seriously affected. This is the work of fault-tolerant designers and their work is increasingly important and complex not only because of the increasing number of “mission critical? applications, but also because the diminishing reliability of hardware means that even systems for non-critical applications will need to be designed with fault-tolerance in mind. Reflecting the real-world challenges faced by designers of these systems, this book addresses fault tolerance design with a systems approach to both hardware and software.

Arguably the greatest book from America''s most heroically ambitious writer, THE EXECUTIONER''S SONG follows the short, blighted life of Gary Gilmore who became famous after he robbed two men in 1976 and killed them in cold blood. After being tried and convicted, he immediately insisted on being executed for his crime. To do so, he fought a system that seemed intent on keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death. And that fight for the right to die is what made him famous. Mailer tells not only Gilmore''s story, but those of the men and women caught in the web of his life and drawn into his procession toward the firing squad. All with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a restraint that evokes the parched landscape and stern theology of Gilmore''s Utah. THE EXECUTIONER''S SONG is a trip down the wrong side of the tracks to the deepest source of American loneliness and violence. It is a towering achievement-impossible to put down, impossible to forget.

Traveling across the country, she visited and talked with fanatics and fang makers, professional haunters, registered mediums, psychologists, and Halloween enthusiasts ranging from NPR''s Garrison Keillor to Incubus guitarist Mike Einziger and The Simpsons'' "Treehouse of Horror" writer Mike Reiss to find out what the increasingly popular holiday means to people and how they celebrate it. Through the course of her research, Bannatyne attended a seance for Houdini, a Samhain ritual gathering, a World Zombie Day event, and the Haunted Attraction National Tradeshow and Convention (HAuNTcon). Diving right into the heart of how fear turned into a form of entertainment, she asks hard-hitting questions: What kind of community does twenty-first-century Halloween create?

In doing so, Europe Undivided illuminates the changing dynamics of the relationship between the EU and candidate states from 1989 to 2004, and challenges policymakers to manage and improve EU leverage to support democracy, ethnic tolerance, and economic reform in other candidates and proto-candidates such as the Western Balkan states, Turkey, and Ukraine.

One day Allan Karl woke up to discover that he was unemployed and his marriage had ended in divorce. Allan looked at these forks in the road of his life as an opportunity to both follow a life-long dream and pursue his passions. He hopped on his motorcycle and traveled around the world. After three years and 62,000 miles of riding, through 35 countries on 5 continents, he returned home only to set out on another journey—to share the truths he''d uncovered and the lessons learned during his adventure around the world. Between these pages, Allan shares the discoveries, cultures, and connections he made on this global adventure. Through stories, color photos, and the flavors of real local food, FORKS brings his adventure to life and the world to your table: the kindness of strangers, the beauty of humanity, the colors of culture, and the powerful gift of human connection.

One the one hand, hackers infect the computers of the world, entering where they are not invited, taking over not just individual workstations but whole networks. On the other, hackers write the software that fuels the Internet, from the most popular web programmes to software fundamental to the Internet''s existence. Beginning from an analysis of these two main types of hackers, categorised as crackers and Free Software/Open Source respectively, Tim Jordan gives the reader insight into the varied identities of hackers, including: * Hacktivism; hackers and populist politics * Cyberwar; hackers and the nation-state * Digital Proletariat; hacking for the man * Viruses; virtual life on the Internet * Digital Commons; hacking without software * Cypherpunks; encryption and digital security * Nerds and Geeks; hacking cultures or hacking without the hack * Cybercrime; blackest of black hat hacking Hackers end debates over the meaning of technological determinism while recognising that at any one moment we are all always determined by technology. Hackers work constantly within determinations of their actions created by technologies as they also alter software to enable entirely new possibilities for and limits to action in the virtual world.

Then followed more than a decade of silence and darkness—until rock and roll repaid the debt it owed this pioneer, helped Lita reclaim her soul, and restored the Queen of Metal to her throne. In 1975, Lita Ford left home at age sixteen to join the world’s first major all-female rock group, the Runaways—a “pioneering band” (New York Times) that became the subject of a Hollywood movie starring Kristen Stewart ad Dakota Fanning. Lita went on to become “heavy rock’s first female guitar hero” (Washington Post), a platinum-selling solo star who shared the bill with the Ramones, Van Halen, Motley Crue, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Poison, and others and who gave Ozzy Osbourne his first Top 10 hit. She was a bare-ass, leather-clad babe whose hair was bigger and whose guitar licks were hotter than any of the guys’. Hailed by Elle as “one of the greatest female electric guitar players to ever pick up the instrument,” Lita spurred the meteoric rise of Joan Jett, Cherie Currie, and the rest of the Runaways. Her phenomenal talent on the fret board also carried her to tremendous individual success after the group’s 1979 disbandment, when she established herself as a “legendary metal icon” (Guitar World) and a fixture of the 1980s music scene who held her own after hours with Nikki Sixx, Jon Bon Jovi, Eddie Van Halen, Tommy Lee, Motorhead’s Lemmy, Black Sabbath’s Tony Iommi (to whom she was engaged), and others. Featuring a foreword by Dee Snider, Living Like a Runaway also provides never-before-told details of Lita’s dramatic personal story. For Lita, life as a woman in the male-dominated rock scene was never easy, a constant battle with the music establishment. But then, at a low point in her career, came a tumultuous marriage that left her feeling trapped, isolated from the rock-and-roll scene for more than a decade, and—most tragically—alienated from her two sons. And yet, after a dramatic and emotional personal odyssey, Lita picked up her guitar and stormed back to the stage. As Guitar Player hailed in 2014 when they inducted her into their hall of fame of guitar greats: “She is as badass as ever.” Fearless, revealing, and compulsively readable, Lita Ford’s Living Like a Runaway is the long-awaited memoir from one of rock’s greatest pioneers—and fiercest survivors.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5m3C_HSK4r0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Living Like a Runaway');

At the end of 2008, Ford Motor Company was just months away from running out of cash. With the auto industry careening toward ruin, Congress offered all three Detroit automakers a bailout. General Motors and Chrysler grabbed the taxpayer lifeline, but Ford decided to save itself. Under the leadership of charismatic CEO Alan Mulally, Ford had already put together a bold plan to unify its divided global operations, transform its lackluster product lineup, and overcome a dys­functional culture of infighting, backstabbing, and excuses. It was an extraordinary risk, but it was the only way the Ford family—America''s last great industrial dynasty—could hold on to their company. Mulally and his team pulled off one of the great­est comebacks in business history. As the rest of Detroit collapsed, Ford went from the brink of bankruptcy to being the most profitable automaker in the world. American Icon is the compelling, behind-the-scenes account of that epic turnaround. On the verge of collapse, Ford went outside the auto industry and recruited Mulally—the man who had already saved Boeing from the deathblow of 9/11—to lead a sweeping restructuring of a company that had been unable to overcome decades of mismanage­ment and denial. Mulally applied the principles he developed at Boeing to streamline Ford''s inefficient operations, force its fractious executives to work together as a team, and spark a product renaissance in Dearborn. He also convinced the United Auto Workers to join his fight for the soul of American manufacturing. Bryce Hoffman reveals the untold story of the covert meetings with UAW leaders that led to a game-changing contract, Bill Ford''s battle to hold the Ford family together when many were ready to cash in their stock and write off the company, and the secret alliance with Toyota and Honda that helped prop up the Amer­ican automotive supply base. In one of the great management narratives of our time, Hoffman puts the reader inside the boardroom as Mulally uses his celebrated Business Plan Review meet­ings to drive change and force Ford to deal with the painful realities of the American auto industry. Hoffman was granted unprecedented access to Ford''s top executives and top-secret company documents. He spent countless hours with Alan Mulally, Bill Ford, the Ford family, former executives, labor leaders, and company directors.

A culinary MacGyver, Ford also provides unique complete do-it-yourself primers for making simple custom outdoor cookers that coax the ultimate flavor out of salmon, pig, rabbit, burgers, bratwurst, turkey, and lamb. Here are easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions, drawings, and timelines for constructing a baking barrel, cinder-block oven, smoking shed, and roasting box in your own backyard. Ford’s food reflects his passion for artisanal techniques, innovative combinations of flavors, and seasonal ingredients. Delicious sides, including Avocado Crostini with Tomatoes, Capers, Olives, Almonds, and Arugula, Persimmon Salad with Goat Cheese and Candied Pecans, Cheddar Cheese Loaf with Artisanal Ham and Spicy Brown Mustard, complement hearty main dishes. Each feast ends on a playful note with delicious desserts like classic S’mores with homemade marshmallows and graham crackers and Coconut and Banana Cream "Pies." Each chapter also includes creative recipes to make use of the leftovers you’re sure to have. Taming the Feast is further enlivened by gorgeous photography and Ford’s stories of growing up with his father Harrison Ford, then a carpenter, and his life as chef at some of California’s most celebrated restaurants working under such pillars of California cuisine as Alice Waters, Paul Bertolli, David Tanis, Nancy Silverton, Mark Peel, and Eberhard Müller. Whether you are hosting a pig roast, a fish fry, or a backyard barbecue family reunion, you can be sure everyone will leave your party entertained, well fed, and raving about the food.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uXF-AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Taming the Feast');

Through vivid photographs and narration, Ford''s boundless energy and vision are revealed. An enthusiastic and courageous entrepreneur, Henry Ford used profits from the Model T to launch projects in a multitude of areas, from education to rubber production. Ford R. Bryan presents an unknown Henry Ford, focusing on his experimental humanitarian and business enterprises- including those that failed. New to this edition are chronicles of factory and general hospitals, nursing schools and services, health clinics, and a research institute established by Henry Ford, and the more than a dozen commissaries Ford operated, selling a wide assortment of items to Ford employees and their families from pillow cases to children''s shoes.

This book outlines a new vision for U.S.-Japan relations that enables both countries to cooperate to achieve their mutual interests, while minimizing the conflicts that will inevitably arise between them. The new U.S.-Japan strategy must incorporate four critical elements. First, the strategy must be based upon a clear conception of U.S. national interest but be implemented in ways that capitalize on the mutual interests of both countries. Second, the strategy must integrate economic and security interests, which the United States decoupled during the cold war era. Third, a new U.S. strategy toward Japan must have an institutional expression, both domestically and internationally, if it is to be viable over the long term. Finally, the United States'' Japan strategy must be part of a new global strategy for facing the challenges of the new world order. Contributors: Susan J. Pharr, Haruo Shimada, Clyde V.

Weight loss is not the key to health, diet and exercise are not effective weight-loss strategies and fatness is not a death sentence. You’ve heard it before: there’s a global health crisis, and, unless we make some changes, we’re in trouble. That much is true—but the epidemic is NOT obesity. The real crisis lies in the toxic stigma placed on certain bodies and the impact of living with inequality—not the numbers on a scale. In a mad dash to shrink our bodies, many of us get so caught up in searching for the perfect diet, exercise program, or surgical technique that we lose sight of our original goal: improved health and well-being. Popular methods for weight loss don’t get us there and lead many people to feel like failures when they can’t match unattainable body standards. It’s time for a cease-fire in the war against obesity. Dr. Linda Bacon and Dr. Lucy Aphramor’s Body Respect debunks common myths about weight, including the misconceptions that BMI can accurately measure health, that fatness necessarily leads to disease, and that dieting will improve health. They also help make sense of how poverty and oppression—such as racism, homophobia, and classism—affect life opportunity, self-worth, and even influence metabolism. Body insecurity is rampant, and it doesn’t have to be. It’s time to overcome our culture’s shame and distress about weight, to get real about inequalities and health, and to show every body respect.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rmQVBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Body Respect');

Ignorance and fear by both practitioners and LGBT clients leads to less-than-optimum public health services. The Handbook of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Public Health extensively discusses these issues clearly, working to foster cultural competency among public health professionals. This book lays the groundwork for better understanding of LGBT health issues and their relationship to overall public health, then delves into the research on how incorporating LGBT cultural competency can improve academic institutions and continuing education programs. The problem of providing health care access and the health issues burdening each segment of the LGBT community are discussed in detail, all with a focus on providing effective solutions to tough challenges. Clear strategies are also presented for improving city, county, state, and national public health infrastructures and policies. The issue of productive and safe work environments in business and the private sector for LGBT individuals is addressed, along with a close look at the advantages—and pitfalls—of media and Internet resources.

One of the keys to this is delivering video in the correct format with the proper compression for that delivery. Real World Video Compression is one of the first books on this topic to demystify the various approaches to compression. It begins by describing the basic concepts of video compression, explains why you might choose a particular compression tool over another, and covers important workflow practices. After the groundwork is laid, readers will learn how to compress their video according to the specific requirements of their projects and will learn some best practices by following the author''s own tips and recipes. Experts in the field lend their own solutions in several sidebars throughout the book, making this a valuable learning tool for anyone learning to encode video, whether they are bloggers, DVD authors, video editors, or students.

Well, congratulations because you have found the right book. Not even the table of contents can show all the lessons contained within this book meant to help consumers fight all types of financial problems just as Danny Singh fights for his mother including avoiding a foreclosure, reclaiming a repossessed car, fixing credit, avoiding deceptive loans as well as checking accounts filled with fees, and getting denied credit applications approved. In response to the student loans crisis looming in America and as a community college student himself, Danny advocates going to a community or state college and doing the maximum number of classes is the best financial decision that can be made versus getting into $100,000 of debt. Without needing bogus and expensive credit repair agencies, Danny will emphasize the most effective debt repayment plans and methods to save money on everyday purchases allowing for consumers to be debt free in months instead of years. Besides student loan debt, Danny expresses credit unions are the solution for consumers to effectively pay off any type of debt such as credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages. Being free of debt will cause their insurance premiums to decrease and increase their chances of better employment. In addition, consumers will be able to enjoy lives free of bankruptcy. Saving for retirement and other financial goals will be a breeze. Despite the financial conditions of a consumer or the economy, perfect credit is never impossible and Danny proves this in Finance 101: The Whiz Kid’s Perfect Credit Guide!

However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem and what is the current state of the art? Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging, and for fun, consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos. More than just a source of “recipes,” this exceptionally authoritative and comprehensive textbook/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting them to produce descriptions of a scene. These problems are also analyzed using statistical models and solved using rigorous engineering techniques Topics and features: structured to support active curricula and project-oriented courses, with tips in the Introduction for using the book in a variety of customized courses; presents exercises at the end of each chapter with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms and containing numerous suggestions for small mid-term projects; provides additional material and more detailed mathematical topics in the Appendices, which cover linear algebra, numerical techniques, and Bayesian estimation theory; suggests additional reading at the end of each chapter, including the latest research in each sub-field, in addition to a full Bibliography at the end of the book; supplies supplementary course material for students at the associated website, http://szeliski.org/Book/.

This third edition has been completely rewritten to provide detailed and up-to-date coverage of key concepts, algorithms, technologies, and applications. The authors explain the principles, as well as the mathematics, underlying computer graphics-knowledge that is essential for successful work both now and in the future. Early chapters show how to create 2D and 3D pictures right away, supporting experimentation. Later chapters, covering a broad range of topics, demonstrate more sophisticated approaches. Sections on current computer graphics practice show how to apply given principles in common situations, such as how to approximate an ideal solution on available hardware, or how to represent a data structure more efficiently. Topics are reinforced by exercises, program­ming problems, and hands-on projects. This revised edition features New coverage of the rendering equation, GPU architecture considerations, and importance- sampling in physically based rendering An emphasis on modern approaches, as in a new chapter on probability theory for use in Monte-Carlo rendering Implementations of GPU shaders, software rendering, and graphics-intensive 3D interfaces 3D real-time graphics platforms-their design goals and trade-offs-including new mobile and browser platforms Programming and debugging approaches unique to graphics development The text and hundreds of figures are presented in full color throughout the book.

An ongoing update by Hannes and Macaitis (2010)identified around 100 additional qualitative or mixed methods syntheses. Yet these generally lack a clear, detailed description of what was done and why (Greenhalgh et al, 2007; McInnes & Wimpenny, 2008). Choices are most commonly influenced by what others have successfully used in the past or by a particular school of thought (Atkins et al, 2008; Britten et al, 2002). This is a substantive limitation. This book brings balance to the options available to researchers, including approaches that have not had a substantial uptake among researchers. It provides arguments for when and why researchers or other parties of interest should opt for a certain approach to synthesis, which challenges they might face in adopting it and what the potential strengths and weaknesses are compared with other approaches.

For Powers, science is something more than the accumulation of technical data and the proliferation of theories developed to explain physical phenomena. It is an evolving body of knowledge which has important insights to contribute into the conditions which ground human experience The close and often detailed discussions of contemporary issues in science which Powers incorporates into his fiction indicate the extent to which he sees science as an inseparable component in any attempt to understand the complexities of human experience. The common ground Powers uses to link the interests of science and those of fiction into a balanced, if not always harmonious, pursuit of truth is wonder. The limitations placed on science during this century do not undermine the ability of science to influence what we can know. Nor do these limitations diminish the ability of science to inspire wonder. Quite the opposite. For Powers the true wonder of the human intellect rests in our remarkable ability to balance observation and interpretation. What he discovers again and again in his fiction is that science, like literature, is a product of the human imagination, a way to mediate between the world and our perceptions of it. The recognition that science is a cultural practice--a body of knowledge thoroughly imbued with the practices and prejudices of its historical surroundings--is a necessary first step in mending the rift separating science and literature, head and heart. The greatest insight of twentieth century science may just be the recognition that there are other ways to access the truth. Richard Powers skillful weaving of science and art is a testament that literature offers a unique vantage point from which we might learn something of value about ourselves and the world we inhabit.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NBkRtT0fQ8AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Synthesizing Systems');

Johanns began to publish a steady stream of articles in the monthly "Light of the East" that analysed pertinent features of "Vedantic" thought from the perspective of his neo-Thomistic presuppositions. Johanns engaged in a thorough explication and analysis of the thinking of the Hindu teachers Sankara, Ramanuja, and Vallabha. He attempted to fashion a creative synthesis of their views, constructing a new, holistic metaphysic from the raw material of their respective philosophical theologies.

Database performance has become a major headache, and most IT departments believe that developers should provide simple SQL code to solve immediate problems and let DBAs tune any "bad SQL" later. In The Art of SQL, author and SQL expert Stephane Faroult argues that this "safe approach" only leads to disaster. His insightful book, named after Art of War by Sun Tzu, contends that writing quick inefficient code is sweeping the dirt under the rug. SQL code may run for 5 to 10 years, surviving several major releases of the database management system and on several generations of hardware. The code must be fast and sound from the start, and that requires a firm understanding of SQL and relational theory. The Art of SQL offers best practices that teach experienced SQL users to focus on strategy rather than specifics. Faroult''s approach takes a page from Sun Tzu''s classic treatise by viewing database design as a military campaign. You need knowledge, skills, and talent. Talent can''t be taught, but every strategist from Sun Tzu to modern-day generals believed that it can be nurtured through the experience of others. They passed on their experience acquired in the field through basic principles that served as guiding stars amid the sound and fury of battle. This is what Faroult does with SQL. Like a successful battle plan, good architectural choices are based on contingencies. What if the volume of this or that table increases unexpectedly? What if, following a merger, the number of users doubles? What if you want to keep several years of data online? Faroult''s way of looking at SQL performance may be unconventional and unique, but he''s deadly serious about writing good SQL and using SQL well. The Art of SQL is not a cookbook, listing problems and giving recipes. The aim is to get you-and your manager-to raise good questions.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HfcMDvxb43AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Art of SQL');

You can avoid them if you understand relational theory, but only if you know how to put the theory into practice. In this insightful book, author C.J. Date explains relational theory in depth, and demonstrates through numerous examples and exercises how you can apply it directly to your use of SQL. This second edition includes new material on recursive queries, “missing information” without nulls, new update operators, and topics such as aggregate operators, grouping and ungrouping, and view updating. If you have a modest-to-advanced background in SQL, you’ll learn how to deal with a host of common SQL dilemmas. Why is proper column naming so important? Nulls in your database are causing you to get wrong answers. Why? What can you do about it? Is it possible to write an SQL query to find employees who have never been in the same department for more than six months at a time? SQL supports “quantified comparisons,” but they’re better avoided. Why? How do you avoid them? Constraints are crucially important, but most SQL products don’t support them properly. What can you do to resolve this situation? Database theory and practice have evolved since the relational model was developed more than 40 years ago. SQL and Relational Theory draws on decades of research to present the most up-to-date treatment of SQL available. C.J. Date has a stature that is unique within the database industry.

Over recent years there have been substantial changes in those industries which are concerned with the design, purchase and use of special purpose (ie critical, high-revenue) rotating equipment. Key personnel have been the victims of early retirement or have moved to other industries: contractors and end-users have reduced their technical staff and consequently have to learn complex material ''from scratch''. As a result, many companies are finding that they are devoting unnecessary man hours to the discovery and explanation of basic principles, and having to explain these to clients who should already be aware of them. In addition, the lack of understanding by contractors and users of equipment characteristics and operating systems often results in a ''wrong fit'' and a costly reliability problem. The stakes can be high, and it against this background that this book has been published. It is the outcome of many years of Bill Forsthoffer''s design, start-up and troubleshooting experience which has resulted in well-honed teaching material which is easily readable, understandable and actually enjoyable! This is a five volume set. The volumes are: 1. Fundamentals of Rotating Equipment 2. Pumps 3. Compressors 4. Auxiliary Systems 5. Reliability Optimization thru Component Condition Monitoring and Root Cause Analysis * One of a five volume set which is the distillation of many years of on-site training by a well-known US Engineer who also operates in the Middle East. * A Practical book written in a succinct style and well illustrated throughout.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Gr9uP4ztcVcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Auxiliary Systems');

In this second edition, leading climate researcher Barrie Pittock revisits the effects that global warming is having on our planet, in light of ever-evolving scientific research. Presenting all sides of the arguments about the science and possible remedies, Pittock examines the latest analyses of climate change, such as new and alarming observations regarding Arctic sea ice, the recently published IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, and the policies of the new Australian Government and how they affect the implementation of climate change initiatives. New material focuses on massive investments in large-scale renewables, such as the kind being taken up in California, as well as many smaller-scale activities in individual homes and businesses which are being driven by both regulatory and market mechanisms. The book includes extensive endnotes with links to ongoing and updated information, as well as some new illustrations. While the message is clear that climate change is here (and in some areas, might already be having disastrous effects), there is still hope for the future, and the ideas presented here will inspire people to take action.

With the audacious belief that the lifestyles of the world''s Blue Zones could be adapted and replicated in towns across North America, Buettner launched the largest preventive health care project in the United States, The Blue Zones City Makeovers, which has impacted the health of millions of Americans since 2009. In The Blue Zones Solution, readers can be inspired by the specific stories of the people, foods, and routines of our healthy elders; understand the role community, family, and naturally healthy habits can play in improving our diet and health; and learn the exact foods—including the 50 superfoods of longevity and dozens of recipes adapted for Western tastes and markets—that offer delicious ways to eat your way to optimum health. Throughout the book are lifestyle recommendations, checklists, and stories to help you create your own personal Blue Zones solution. Readers will learn and apply the 80/20 rule, the plant slant diet, social aspects of eating that lead to weight loss and great health naturally, cultivating your "tribe" of friends and family, and your greater purpose as part of your daily routine. Filled with moving personal stories, delicious recipes, checklists, and useful tips that will transform any home into a miniature blue zone, The Blue Zones Solution is the ultimate blueprint for a healthy, happy life.

We like to think of these tablets, capsules, patches, and ointments as interchangeable with their brand-name counterparts: why pay more for the same??And yet they are not quite the same. They differ in price, in place of origin, in color, shape, and size, in the dyes, binders, fillers, and coatings used, and in a host of other ways. Claims of generic equivalence, as physician-historian Jeremy Greene reveals in this gripping narrative, are never based on being identical to the original drug in all respects, but in being the same in all ways that matter. How do we know what parts of a pill really matter? Decisions about which differences are significant and which are trivial in the world of therapeutics are not resolved by simple chemical or biological assays alone. As Greene reveals in this fascinating account, questions of therapeutic similarity and difference are also always questions of pharmacology and physiology, of economics and politics, of morality and belief. Generic is the first book to chronicle the social, political, and cultural history of generic drugs in America.?It narrates the evolution of the generic drug industry from a set of mid-twentieth-century "schlock houses" and "counterfeiters" into an agile and surprisingly powerful set of multinational corporations in the early twenty-first century. The substitution of bioequivalent generic drugs for more expensive brand-name products is a rare success story in a field of failed attempts to deliver equivalent value in health care for a lower price. Greene’s history sheds light on the controversies shadowing the success of generics: problems with the generalizability of medical knowledge, the fragile role of science in public policy, and the increasing role of industry, marketing, and consumer logics in late-twentieth-century and early twenty-first century health care. -- Siddhartha Mukherjee, Assistant Professor of Medicine, Columbia University, author of The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of CancerCharles E.

He foreshadowed the fact that he was going to be ''broken'' and ''poured out''--- he was going to take humanity''s punishment for sin on himself. While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, ''Take and eat; this is my body.'' Then he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, ''Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father''s kingdom.'' Jesus warned his disciples that he would be with them only a little while longer. He went on to comfort his confused followers. ''Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. My Father''s house has plenty of room; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place where I am going.'' Thomas said to him, ''Lord, we don''t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?'' Jesus answered, ''I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

However, few books are available to train professionals and students who are not professional programmers to develop these information systems. Developing Windows-Based and Web-Enabled Information Systems fills this gap, providing a self-contained, easy-to-understand, and well-illustrated text that explores current concepts, methods, and software tools for developing Windows-based and web-enabled information systems. Written in an easily accessible style, the book details current concepts, methods, and software tools for Windows-based and web-enabled information systems that store and use data. It is self-contained with easy-to-understand small examples to walk through concepts and implementation details along with large-scale case studies. The book describes data modeling methods including entity–relationship modeling, relational modeling and normalization, and object-oriented data modeling, to develop data models of a database. The author covers how to use software tools in the Microsoft application development environment, including Microsoft Access, MySQL, SQL, Visual Studio, Visual Basic, VBA, HTML, and XML, to implement databases and develop Windows-based and web-enabled applications with the database, graphical user interface, and program components. The book takes you through the entire process of developing a computer and network application for an information system, highlighting concepts and operation details.

Organizations need an effective method of accessing, visualizing, and reducing spatial information accessibility time. This is important for government organizations and GIS community. The WebGIS methodology was used as a way of reducing the tediousness of spatial information accessibility. This research investigated users'' difficulties in accessing spatial information within various GIS environments as well as the inherent difficulties of the spatial information environment. After the sample population group completed the survey, descriptive statistics were used to analyze the study data. The results showed that spatial information retrieving skills and uneasiness changed at a 5% level of significance as a result of the treatment. This finding is particularly important for Geographic Information Officers (GIO), GIS users, and geo-decision makers faced with increasingly larger spatial information; the GPS data logger treatment can be used as an alternative to traditional, mind-numbing, GIS accessibility methods. Users constrained by distance and technology may also realize a direct benefit. The study''s sample population indicated that they would use the WebGIS treatment again. Increased GIS user accessibility time, user flexibility, and contributions to the GIS field combined, have impacted positive social change.

Well, congratulations because you have found the right book. Not even the table of contents can show all the lessons contained within this book meant to help consumers fight all types of financial problems just as Danny Singh fights for his mother including avoiding a foreclosure, reclaiming a repossessed car, fixing credit, avoiding deceptive loans as well as checking accounts filled with fees, and getting denied credit applications approved. In response to the student loans crisis looming in America and as a community college student himself, Danny advocates going to a community or state college and doing the maximum number of classes is the best financial decision that can be made versus getting into $100,000 of debt. Without needing bogus and expensive credit repair agencies, Danny will emphasize the most effective debt repayment plans and methods to save money on everyday purchases allowing for consumers to be debt free in months instead of years. Besides student loan debt, Danny expresses credit unions are the solution for consumers to effectively pay off any type of debt such as credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages. Being free of debt will cause their insurance premiums to decrease and increase their chances of better employment. In addition, consumers will be able to enjoy lives free of bankruptcy. Saving for retirement and other financial goals will be a breeze. Despite the financial conditions of a consumer or the economy, perfect credit is never impossible and Danny proves this in Finance 101: The Whiz Kid’s Perfect Credit Guide!

In this provocative and engaging book, John Mueller argues that these mismatches between image and reality create significant political and economic problems--inspiring instability, inefficiency, and widespread cynicism. We would be far better off, he writes, if we recognized that neither system is ideal or disastrous and accepted instead the humdrum truth that both are "pretty good." And, to Mueller, that means good enough. He declares that what is true of Garrison Keillor''s fictional store "Ralph''s Pretty Good Grocery" is also true of democracy and capitalism: if you can''t get what you want there, "you can probably get along without it." Mueller begins by noting that capitalism is commonly thought to celebrate greed and to require discourtesy, deceit, and callousness. However, with examples that range from car dealerships and corporate boardrooms to the shop of an eighteenth-century silk merchant, Mueller shows that capitalism in fact tends to reward behavior that is honest, fair, civil, and compassionate. He argues that this gap between image and reality hampers economic development by encouraging people to behave dishonestly, unfairly, and discourteously to try to get ahead and to neglect the virtuous behavior that is an important source of efficiency and gain. The problem with democracy''s image, by contrast, is that our expectations are too high. We are too often led by theorists, reformers, and romantics to believe that democracy should consist of egalitarianism and avid civic participation. In fact, democracy will always be chaotic, unequal, and marked by apathy. It offers reasonable freedom and security, but not political paradise. To idealize democracy, Mueller writes, is to undermine it, since the inevitable contrast with reality creates public cynicism and can hamper democracy''s growth and development. Mueller presents these arguments with sophistication, wit, and erudition. He combines mastery of current political and economic literature with references to figures ranging from Plato to P. T. Barnum, from Immanuel Kant to Ronald Reagan, from Shakespeare to Frank Capra. Broad in scope and rich in detail, the book will provoke debate among economists, political scientists, and anyone interested in the problems (or non-problems) of modern democracy and capitalism.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MHCyoBveovcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Capitalism, Democracy, and Ralph''s Pretty Good Grocery');

This work examines internal psychological processes and external societal processes as the feminist movement in Taiwan expands and new gender roles are explored. The chapter authors represent a cross-section of disciplines -- history, anthropology, and sociology -- and different generations of China/Taiwan scholars. The book places the issues facing Taiwan''s women''s movement in social, political, and economic contexts. It examines gender relations, the role of women in Chinese society, and issues related to women throughout history. Feminism and gender relations are also viewed from the context of film and literature. The authors look at the contemporary roles that women play in Taiwan''s work force and how the sexes perceive each other in the workplace. They discuss the role of women during Taiwan''s industrialization, their role in the island''s commercial and agricultural sectors, and more.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TUb67zCjlqIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Women in the New Taiwan');

The same phenomenon can be observed in college dining halls, faculty lounges, and corporate cafeterias. What is going on here? Is this self-segregation a problem we should try to fix, or a coping strategy we should support? How can we get past our reluctance to talk about racial issues to even discuss it? And what about all the other questions we and our children have about race?

Using real-life examples and the latest research, Tatum presents strong evidence that straight talk about our racial identities-whatever they may be-is essential if we are serious about facilitating communication across racial and ethnic divides.

In fleeing the UK — temporarily — Elizabeth may also be in flight from her past and the charismatic Arthur, once her partner in what she came to see as a series of crimes. Together they acted as fake mediums, perfecting the arcane skills practiced by effective frauds. Elizabeth finally rejected what once seemed an intoxicating game. Arthur continued his search for the right way to do wrong. He now subsidizes free closure for the traumatized and dispossessed by preying on the super-rich. The pair still meet occasionally, for weekends of sexual oblivion, but their affection lacerates as much as it consoles. Elizabeth hadn''t, however, expected the other man on the boat. As her voyage progresses, Elizabeth''s past is revealed, and codes slowly form and break as communication deepens. It''s time for her to discover who are the true deceivers and who are the truly deceived. But is the book itself — a fiction which may not always be lying — deceiving the reader?

In this impressive collection of short fiction, she uses simple phrases to capture a character perfectly; at the same time, she knows when to unleash her controlled prose, freeing it for poetic evocations of landscapes or moments.

Hood manages to be both funny and perceptive as she adopts the voice of each character in turn. The title piece is an ambitious novella in which Hood''s experiments with time do not quite work, but she deftly renders a family''s complex relationships and at the same time creates the ambience of a mill-town community.

Interest in financial markets implies interest in underlying macroeconomic fundamentals. In Financial and Macroeconomic Connectedness, Frank Diebold and Kamil Yilmaz propose a simple framework for defining, measuring, and monitoring connectedness, which is central to finance and macroeconomics. These measures of connectedness are theoretically rigorous yet empirically relevant. The approach to connectedness proposed by the authors is intimately related to the familiar econometric notion of variance decomposition. The full set of variance decompositions from vector auto-regressions produces the core of the ''connectedness table.'' The connectedness table makes clear how one can begin with the most disaggregated pair-wise directional connectedness measures and aggregate them in various ways to obtain total connectedness measures. The authors also show that variance decompositions define weighted, directed networks, so that these proposed connectedness measures are intimately related to key measures of connectedness used in the network literature. After describing their methods in the first part of the book, the authors proceed to characterize daily return and volatility connectedness across major asset (stock, bond, foreign exchange and commodity) markets as well as the financial institutions within the U.S. and across countries since late 1990s. These specific measures of volatility connectedness show that stock markets played a critical role in spreading the volatility shocks from the U.S. to other countries. Furthermore, while the return connectedness across stock markets increased gradually over time the volatility connectedness measures were subject to significant jumps during major crisis events. This book examines not only financial connectedness, but also real fundamental connectedness. In particular, the authors show that global business cycle connectedness is economically significant and time-varying, that the U.S. has disproportionately high connectedness to others, and that pairwise country connectedness is inversely related to bilateral trade surpluses.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L4IwBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Financial and Macroeconomic Connectedness');

Rich. Morgan, thirty, is completing her thesis on victim psychology and newly engaged to Bennett, a man more possessive than those she has dated in the past, but also more chivalrous—and the sex is hot. She returns from class one day to find Bennett brutally mauled to death, and her beloved dogs covered in blood. When Morgan tries to locate Bennett’s parents to tell them about their son’s hideous death, she discovers that everything he has told her—where he was born, where he lives in Montreal, where he works—was a lie. He is not the man he said he was, and he had several fiancées, all believing the same promises he gave Morgan. And then, one by one, these other women are murdered. Morgan’s research into Bennett has taken on new urgency: in order to stay alive, she must find out how an intelligent woman like herself, who studies predators, becomes a victim. For readers of Girl on a Train and Luckiest Girl Alive, this “twisty, unsettling thriller” (The New York Times) is an “irresistible” (Vogue) collaboration between two outstanding writers. “The Hand That Feeds You goes from zero to terrifying in about five pages…Once this thriller gets its teeth into you, it doesn’t let go” (The Tampa Bay Times).', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l0kjBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Hand That Feeds You');

It is similar to the author''s Anne of Green Gables series. It was first published in 1923. Similar to her earlier and more famous Anne of Green Gables series, the Emily novels depicted life through the eyes of a young orphan girl, Emily Starr, who is raised by her relatives after her father dies of tuberculosis. Montgomery considered Emily to be a character much closer to her own personality than Anne, and some of the events which occur in the Emily series happened to Montgomery herself. Emily is described as having black hair, purply violet eyes, elfin ears, pale skin and a unique and enchanting "slow" smile. Emily Starr is sent to live at New Moon Farm on Prince Edward Island with her aunts Elizabeth and Laura Murray and her Cousin Jimmy. She makes friends with Ilse Burnley, Teddy Kent, and Perry Miller, the hired boy, who Aunt Elizabeth looks down upon because he was born in ''Stovepipe Town'', a poorer district. Each of the children has a special gift. Emily was born to be a writer, Teddy is a gifted artist, Ilse is a talented elocutionist, and Perry has the makings of a great politician. They also each have a few problems with their families. Emily has a hard time getting along with Aunt Elizabeth, who does not understand her need to write. Ilse''s father, Dr. Burnley, ignores Ilse most of the time because of a dreadful secret concerning Ilse''s mother. Teddy''s mother is jealous of her son''s talents and friends, fearing that his love for them will eclipse his love for her; as a result, she hates Emily, Teddy''s drawings, and even his pets. Perry is not as well off as the other three, so his Aunt Tom once tries to make Emily promise to marry Perry when they grow up, threatening that unless Emily does so, she will not pay for Perry''s schooling. Other unforgettable characters are Dean "Jarback" Priest, a quiet, mysterious cynic who wants something he fears is ever unattainable; fiery Mr Carpenter, the crusty old schoolteacher who is Emily''s mentor and honest critic when it comes to evaluating her stories and poems; "simple" Cousin Jimmy, who recites his poetry when the spirit moves him; and strict, suspicious Aunt Ruth who yet proves to be an unexpected ally in times of trouble. This was the most loved book in the series. Lucy Maud Montgomery - Lucy Maud Montgomery (November 30, 1874 – April 24, 1942), publicly known as L. M. Montgomery, was a Canadian author best known for a series of novels beginning in 1908 with Anne of Green Gables. The book was an immediate success. The central character, Anne Shirley, an orphaned girl, made Montgomery famous in her lifetime and gave her an international following. The first novel was followed by a series of sequels with Anne as the central character. Montgomery went on to publish 20 novels as well as 530 short stories, 500 poems...', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2im-DAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'Emily of New Moon');

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty--and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition--in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use.

It offers readers a systematic approach to domain-driven design, presenting an extensive set of design best practices, experience-based techniques, and fundamental principles that facilitate the development of software projects facing complex domains. Intertwining design and development practice, this book incorporates numerous examples based on actual projects to illustrate the application of domain-driven design to real-world software development. Readers learn how to use a domain model to make a complex development effort more focused and dynamic. A core of best practices and standard patterns provides a common language for the development team. A shift in emphasis–refactoring not just the code but the model underlying the code–in combination with the frequent iterations of Agile development leads to deeper insight into domains and enhanced communication between domain expert and programmer. Domain-Driven Design then builds on this foundation, and addresses modeling and design for complex systems and larger organizations.Specific topics covered include: With this book in hand, object-oriented developers, system analysts, and designers will have the guidance they need to organize and focus their work, create rich and useful domain models, and leverage those models into quality, long-lasting software implementations.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hHBf4YxMnWMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Domain-Driven Design');

The Second Intermediate Period separates the two glorious periods of the Middle Kingdom and the New Kingdom. During the 19th century BC, an invasion by Canaanite tribes into the Egyptian Delta took place. Around 1800 BC, these people proclaimed their own king and the Delta thus became independent from the rest of Egypt. Egypt remained split between Canaanite kings in the north and native Egyptian kings in the south for the remainder of the Second Intermediate Period. The division of Egypt brought about an economic decline, and the entire period is characterised by a lack of royal monuments. This circumstance has greatly hampered attempts to establish a chronology of the period and, as a consequence, it has been very difficult to date many sources which are relevant for the social and political situation of the period. The Second Intermediate Period has, therefore, remained one of the most obscure periods of Egypt''s ancient history. The first chapter discusses the primary sources for the chronology of the period. It includes a revised restoration and a comprehensive source evaluation of the famous Turin King-list, a papyrus from the New Kingdom (1550-1100 BC), which contains the only complete king-list from Pharaonic Egypt. The second chapter, the individual dynasties/kingdoms of the period are systematically defined according to their kings, geographical and chronological extent. The fourth and final chapter contains an historical outline of the political situation during the Second Intermediate Period, based on the conclusions in the study. Appended to the work is a catalogue of all the sources, approximately 1500, known to contain the names of the Egyptian kings of the period. Each source is briefly described in terms of type, origin and present location, followed by bibliographical references. This catalogue, which also includes some unpublished material, is intended to facilitate further research into the period.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ANRi7cM5ZwsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Political Situation in Egypt During the Second Intermediate Period, C. 1800-1550 B.C.');

Even the Greeks and Romans found it difficult to gain a theoretical understanding of this genre, and modern readers often avoid such texts, which they perceive as dry and overly technical. Volk offers a new theoretical look at this genre, discussing the characteristics that make a poem ''didactic'' from the points of view of both theory and literary history, and tracing its history from Hesiod to Roman times. This discussion leads into detailed interpretations of four great Latin didactic poems: Lucretius'' De rerum natura, Vergil''s Georgics, Ovid''s Ars Amatoria, and Manilius'' Astronomica. Volk cocludes that didactic poems, though belonging to a genre often regarded as unpoetic, typically present themselves self-consciously as poetry and give particular attention to discussions of poetics.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HxSzIwsQUJAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Poetics of Latin Didactic');

Critics in this century have been less dismissive of the genre, but seem puzzled by it. There has been a tendency to treat a didactic poem as though it were a kind of lyric, in which the focus of interest lies in the emotions and feelings of the writer. But didactic poetry has a purpose, history, and character of its own. This original and important book asks the question, ''What can the practising critic usefully say about a didactic poem?'' This is not primarily a book about theory, but a guide to practical criticism combined with a fresh reading of the chosen texts. Through a close analysis of three of the major didactic poems in the classical canon, the De rerum natura of Lucretius, the Georgics of Virgil, and the Ars amatoria of Ovid, Dalzell''s aim is to consider these poems as a genre and to ascertain what tools are available to the critic for their understanding. He raises questions about the limits of genre criticism, the relationship of poetry and knowledge, reader-response, and historical reception. Can there be a poetry of statement? Is all genuine poetry necessarily fictive in some sense? To what extent is a serious didactic intent compatible with poetry? "The Criticism of Didactic Poetry" is primarily of interest to classicists. It will also be of great value to scholars of other literatures who are interested in the history of the genre or in the theoretical debate about whether poetry can encompass knowledge. This book is a significant original contribution to the field, with the potential to influence future scholarly thinking on didactic poetry.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jnesVOfjEKYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Criticism of Didactic Poetry');

In this monograph Matthew E. Gordley provides a broad definition of didactic hymnody and examines how didactic hymns functioned at the intersection of historical circumstances and the needs of a given community to perceive itself and its place in the cosmos and to respond accordingly. Comparing the use of didactic hymnody in a variety of traditions, this study illuminates the multifaceted ways that ancient hymns and psalms contributed to processes of communal formation among the human audiences that participated in the praise either as hearers or active participants.

The secret political movement here introduced to the reader has contributed more to the sensational character of American politics, and, at the same time, proven a more influential factor in those political questions with which we have dealt as a people, than any or all contemporaneous issues. And yet nothing has been written on the theme bearing a just proportion thereto,—absolutely nothing,—if we subtract the unknown quantity in the news problem of the day from this estimate, and for reasons as varied as obvious. We shall not weary the reader with a statement of the latter, nor a recitative of the conditions upon which they are or may have been based. It is enough that we know that no consecutive nor reliable history of the Order could have been written at an earlier period; and even at this date, so broken and fragmentary are those passages referring to its active career, compiled during months of arduous labor, that the author has been necessitated to group them in a series of historical sketches, or pen-pictures, and in treating the subject to adopt the style of the romancist, rather than that of the historian. He flatters himself, however, that while the reliability of his historical information is not impaired by this method, that the work will thereby be rendered more attractive to a large class of readers; and, on the other hand, as to facts connected with the morale of the weird subject, he is not hampered by these considerations, but is enabled to present them in such a concise form, and as sententiously as regards style, as their share of the task’s importance renders peremptory. From the moment that the resolution to compose these sketches in the interest of the reading public became fixed in the author’s mind, he has been in constant communication with individuals who were not only influential leaders of the secret movement, but held high official rank under it; so that the authenticity of his statements affecting its regimé is placed so far beyond question that the reader is at liberty to take the latter as ex cathedra utterances of this singularly reticent body. Should those passages which are occupied with the more exciting events of K. K. K. history be calculated to awaken sensation in the public breast, it is a contretemps from which the author begs to excuse himself in the light of the same admission, adding, moreover, that he has availed himself of those examples which have gone before him in this department of literature, and reserved his art-flourishes for less susceptible divisions of the theme.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=a0gYlSRXSboC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'K.

Loyola''s Bees is the first full-length study of the Latin didactic poetry of the Society of Jesus, a Catholic Reformation order whose priests were the leading exponents of the genre in the early modern period. If post-Romantic readers have, in the main, lost the taste for a ''poetry of things'', the poems in this book will command scholarly attention at least for what they reveal about early modern social, cultural, and intellectual life, Jesuit attitudes to the New World and the New Science, and the circulation of Latin literature in France and Italy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. But modern readers will also be pleasantly surprised by their literary qualities. Often elegant, witty, and for all their enthusiastic engagement with contemporary events and inventions, self-consciously ''classical'' in form, Jesuit didactic poems are a treasure waiting to be discovered by students of the classical tradition. Loyola''s Bees is no mere descriptive survey, however. Haskell sets out to resolve the paradox of the crack troops of early modern Catholicism devoting so much time to the composition of Latin verse of a secular orientation. Poems on a wide and disparate range of subjects are analysed from the unifying perspective of Jesuit ideology, and Haskell articulates the ways in which the Society''s distinctive brand of humanist pedagogy, together with its apostolic (world-directed) spiritual ethos, determined both the specific forms and vigorous fortune of the Latin didactic genre in the early modern period.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aB9kmG5QdJgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Loyola''s Bees');

Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City shook the nation, destroying our complacent sense of safety and sending a community into a tailspin of shock, grief, and bewilderment. Almost as difficult as the bombing itself has been the aftermath, its legacy for Oklahoma City and for the nation, and the struggle to recover from this unprecedented attack. In The Unfinished Bombing, Edward T. Linenthal explores the many ways Oklahomans and other Americans have tried to grapple with this catastrophe. Working with exclusive access to materials gathered by the Oklahoma City National Memorial Archive and drawing from over 150 personal interviews with family members of those murdered, survivors, rescuers, and many others. Linenthal looks at how the bombing threatened cherished ideas about American innocence, sparked national debate on how to respond to terrorism at home and abroad, and engendered a new "bereaved community" in Oklahoma City itself. Linenthal examines how different stories about the bombing were told through positive narratives of civic renewal and of religious redemption and more negative narratives of toxicity and trauma. He writes about the extraordinary bonds of affection that were created in the wake of the bombing, acts of kindness, empathy, and compassion that existed alongside the toxic legacy of the event. The Unfinished Bombing offers a compelling look at both the individual and the larger cultural consequences of one of the most searing events in recent American history.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1WDS-INyWXEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Unfinished Bombing');

At his Los Angeles restaurant, Crossroads, the menu is vegan, but there are no soybeans or bland seitan to be found. He and his executive chef, Scot Jones, turn seasonal vegetables, beans, nuts, and grains into sophisticated Mediterranean fare—think warm bowls of tomato-sauced pappardelle, plates of spicy carrot salad, and crunchy flatbreads piled high with roasted vegetables. In Crossroads, an IACP Cookbook Award finalist, Ronnen teaches readers to make his recipes and proves that the flavors we crave are easily replicated in dishes made without animal products. With accessible, unfussy recipes, Crossroads takes plant-based eating firmly out of the realm of hippie health food and into a cuisine that fits perfectly with today’s modern palate. The recipes are photographed in sumptuous detail, and with more than 100 of them for weeknight dinners, snacks and appetizers, special occasion meals, desserts, and more, this book is an indispensable resource for healthy, mindful eaters everywhere.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E8IWBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Crossroads');

And it was her own personal journey that inspired Elle Luna to write a brief online manifesto that, in a few short months, has touched hundreds of thousands of people who’ve read it or heard Elle speak on the topic. Now Ms. Luna expands her ideas into an inspirational, highly visual gift book for every recent graduate, every artist, every seeker, every career changer. The Crossroads of Should and Must has a universal message—we get to choose the path between Should and Must. And it gives every reader permission to embrace this message. It’s about the difference between jobs, careers, and callings. The difference between going to work and becoming one with your work. Why knowing what you want is often the hardest part. It gives eye-opening techniques for reconnecting with one’s inner voice, like writing your own obituary (talk about putting life in perspective). It talks about the most common fears of choosing Must over Should—money, time, space, and the ultimate fear: total vulnerability—and shores up our hesitation with inspiring stories of and quotes from the artists and writers and thinkers who’ve faced their own crossroads of Should and Must and taken the leap. It explains the importance of mistakes, of “unlearning,” of solitude, of keeping moving, of following a soul path. Presented in four chapters—The Crossroads, The Origin of Should, Must, and The Return—inspired by the hero’s journey outlined by Joseph Campbell, The Crossroads of Should and Must guides us from the small moment, discovering our Must, to the big moment—actually doing something about it, and returning to share our new gifts with the world.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FpKdBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Crossroads of Should and Must');

She goes on to suggest that fraud and the abuse of trust could have a widespread impact on American economy and prosperity, and argues that the way to counter this disturbing trend is to reverse the culture of business dishonesty. Finally, she presents the following thesis: If Americans have had enough of financial abuse, they can demand of their leaders, of themselves, and of each other more honesty and trust and less cynicism. Americans can reject the actions, attitudes, theories and assumptions that brought us the corporate scandals of the 1990s. Though American society can have "bad apples," and its constituents hold differing opinions about the precise meaning of trust and truth, it can remain honest, as long as it aspires to honesty.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YvKcf18kNxYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Trust and Honesty');

The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is conducting the single monetary policy with the main goal of preserving price stability and supporting economic growth. However, the effectiveness of its monetary policy remains low, with a weak reaction of market interest rates and inflation to BCEAO’s policy actions. The paper concludes that, while the institutional setup and the instruments of monetary policy are adequate, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy remains constrained by liquidity management practices, shallow and segmented financial markets, and interest rate rigidities. To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy the BCEAO should be more proactive in determining the stance of fiscal policies, develop financial markets, and liberalize controlled interest rates. The BCEAO is undertaking important reforms in these directions.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Zm_RCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'How to Improve the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy in the West African Economic and Monetary Union');

While private copying was practiced in the analogue world too, it was tolerated due to its minimal impact and to the difficulties related to its monitoring. Yet, its permissibility is ambiguous in the digital environment; this is because digitalisation has enabled ordinary individuals to make and share copies of copyrighted works easily, for no cost and with no degradation in terms of quality. Scholars and lawmakers stress the decisive role of private copying in striking an adequate balance between the freedom to use copyrighted works and the protection of the rightholders'' interests in the digital world. In Europe, private copying is explicitly permitted under Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society and the national laws that implement it. Despite being a lawful activity in the great majority of European Member States, digital private copying remains a highly controversial phenomenon and the scope of digital private copying remains legally unclear.This book offers an original analysis of private copying and determines the actual scope of private copying as an area of end-user freedom in the digital world. In particular, it examines the permissibility of digital private copying with a view to clarify the legal uncertainty as to its scope. The basis of this examination is Article 5(2)(b) of the Information Society Directive. Under this Article, the use of copyrighted works ought to be ''private'' and ''non-commercial'' to be permitted; these concepts, however, do not translate well, and tend to be less sharp, in the digital environment.

One policy that meets these criteria and warrants consideration is a farm savings account (FSA). It is crucial that the role of a FSA in a farm household''s portfolio is understood before implementing it as policy. Consequently, this research uses a discrete stochastic programming model to investigate the relationship between the FSA and the portfolio allocation choices (consumption, land allocation, stock, and debt) for a utility-maximizing farmer in a theoretical and empirical framework. This analysis shows that a FSA can help stabilize, enhance, and/or reduce the variability in wealth. The results also suggest that the availability of a FSA as an investment has significant impact on the asset allocation patterns for the household. First, the presence of matching government contributions motivates the household in ever year when they have sufficient cash to contribute funds to the FSA to receive these government contributions. This result occurs irrespective of the initial endowments, risk aversion level, and presence of other U.S. farm policies. Access to the FSA causes the household to decrease purchases of stocks compared to a household without access to the FSA. Second, the powerful income protection effects of the FSA help explain the observed willingness of the household to make annual land purchase decisions that are far larger than in the scenario without the FSA. In turn, this causes the household to have a much larger percentage of its assets financed with debt capital. The availability of a FSA results in modest increases in average terminal wealth, lower variability in terminal wealth, and no significant change in average annual consumption, but lower variability in consumption. Finally, as the amount of farmland in the portfolio grows, a decrease in the probability of a withdrawal and an increase in the size of the average withdrawal from the FSA can be observed. These results are consistent with prior research on the National Income Stabilization Account (NISA), a Canadian farm policy similar to the FSA.', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4q7rZArbASYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Effect of Farm Savings Accounts on Farm Households'' Portfolios');
